Rooms was large enough to put away all clothing and items. Bathroom small but efficient and the shower water was hot immediately. Crew were polite and the captain spoke to everyone. He often advised us of interesting things to see and would turn the ship 360 degrees so we could view everything or would go up to an ice shelf to show us penguins. Expedition leaders and the captain were smitten by Antarctica and keen to show us everything. We were with a Tauck group of 100, there were 60 other guests on the ship as well. Three Tauck tour guides were wonderful and often left practical gifts in our staterooms for us. No issues with dining, both quality and variety were superb and we got to know the staff well in ten days. Weather was perfect the entire time, calm and sunny with plus 4C. Library in the lounge had great books, lectures daily on what to see. Cocktails were included in our Tauck package. Free wine and beer at all meals and champagne served often.Crew were very careful loading and unloading the Zodiacs.went out twice daily.  Jackets were ours to keep, boots borrowed. Wore casual clothing but brought a pair of black dress pants and a nice sweater for suppers. Nothing formal, one captain’s dinner. Excellent cruise, no issues with anything.

This is a company that will irritate you with a ton of small mistakes that you're required to solve yourself.  It starts with the booking process, and continues until you are taken off the boat.  Tauck staff is not at all interested in working with the passengers.  Often fail to manage the various tours in an organized and coherent manner.  Their systems support is weak, and expect a lot of apologies and nothing much else.  My critique sent to CEO Dan Mahar went unanswered.

We have been on luxury cruises like Regent and the lower end like Carnival ,plus many more in between like Princess etc. What you pay for is normally what you get.This was medium to upper price The staff on the ship were very arrogant and spoke mainly in French .The rules and regulations drove us crazy. You would go to the observation bar before lunch for a drink and then they would close the bar for an hour , You would be in the main lounge and ask a waiter for an orange juice .He would look at you and not respond ,you never knew if he went to get it or not. First night in the main dinning room ,the menu was so small ,we requested anything chicken or salmon .We were told that was not possible. Ended up with a burger and fries. This was not what we expected on a high end cruise. Next night is was a set gala dinner. Very poor small portions of different types of fish. So third night decided to go to the buffett .We arrived at 8pm to a very sparsely attended dining room. The head waiter asked if we had a reservation as all the empty tables were reserved .We told him no. He seated us at an empty table .We ate until 9pm ( good food this night) and only 10 other guests showed up. This buffett closes at 9pm. For breakfast you have a 2 hour window mainly 7am to 9am. They will start clearing your plates that you are eating on at 8.45am .Just plain crazy .Staff need training. Our first port of call from Vancouver was San Francisco .It took near 5 hours to clear customs .I asked a customs officer when we finally got cleared why the hold up. He said it was lack of communications on compliance from the ship's crew. We have cleared this port many times on bigger ships in less than 2 hours. There were some good points on being on a ship with only 132 cabins . The Captain spotted a pod of Orca whales and he stopped the ship for half hour for us to watch them play. Very exciting.We were allowed to tour the bridge if the green sign was on the door.This was interesting although no crew member spoke to us . We found it strange that they do not employ females to work as waiters or bartenders ,in this day and age that is different. Most cruise ships have mixed nationality crews ,this being mainly French gave us a lesson in how certain countries operate. They operated the tender service in Monterey very well. We love the concept of small cruise ships ,but will stick with Regent if we spring for the higher end next time",Sail Date: September 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: United States|,"Palm Springs, California"

It is French, chic, the service is smooth, and passengers are well-heeled, experienced and predominantly elder travellers. We choose Le Soléal for its off-the-beaten-track itinerary and most of all for the North West Passage. We called at various shores at Greenland’s West coast, and islands of North Canada Nunavut. On board Zodiacs ferry passengers across to remote shores. We found the staff very capable and the excursion staff of young scientists, marine biologists & naturalists very knowledgeable.Unfortunately in 2018 too much sea ice in the islands of Northern Canada forced the ship to turn back to Kangerlussuaq. Most passenger departed Greenland by plane. Finally it became for us a 10,200 nautical miles voyage ending in San Diego.Our cabin was nicely furnished and decorated, with a comfortable bed, a flat screen TV, a mini bar replenished daily and included in the open bar policy. The amidships cabins are best for passengers prone to seasickness but face a slight noise from the ship’s engines. The vessel has a theatre, a gym, a small spa, a shop with designer labels, a beauty parlour, a spacious lounge with bar, a comfy library with bar and two pleasant restaurants, all open sitting. The restaurant on deck 6 is casual and on deck 2 more formal. Both restaurants are nicely appointed, the waiting staff very efficient and correct. The vessel has an open bar policy that includes drinks, apéritif, cocktails, champagne, digestif, and wines - with the exception of the grand crus. The wine list is impressive and top wines are on display at the right temperature and available at the restaurant on deck 2.Dress code is smart-casual with a couple of extra-smart nights although no rules are laid down. For Arctic and Antarctic voyages Ponant provides a parka and rubber boots. Passengers often go seriously chic and we advise ladies to pack a cocktail dress and some heels for the smarter nights. There's no requirement for men to pack jackets and ties, although a lot of men did wear blazers on the smart nights. Numerous activities, from gymnastics in the morning, lectures in the afternoon to a piano concert or a dance show at night in the theatre. At sea the ship has an open bridge policy. Food is French cuisine and very good. For suites there is a butler service. At the restaurant the French tone of course is prevalent. All officers are French, the crew a mixture of Filipino and Indonesian, and all English speaking.We had a great voyage. Although we missed the North West Passage we visited remote places like Sisimiut, Ilulissat, Akullek, Kullorsuaq, Savissivil, Pond Inlet, Trembley, Fort Ross, Qariaraqyuk, Somerset, Philpots, Devin, Coburg, Ellesmere, Craig Harbour, Fjord Bowdoin, Siorapaluk, Etah, Dundas, Thule, Qagsserssuaq, Nuliafrik and Qullissat.Overall Le Soléal is a beautiful ship, no casino and no rowdy teenagers.",Sail Date: September 2018|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Canada|,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands"

There are only three in this category - all on the 6th level.My ratings are:Cabin - excellent, though the ante-room is all closets which makes the room a bit dark as you enter.   Same cabin on its sister-ship, L’Austral, has a slightly different (and I think better) configuration with more natural light and on entering, you can see straight thru the beautiful cabin to the balcony.Food:  better than excellent — it is French!    Complimentary wine at meals, open bar, complimentary mini-bar.  There are two restaurants:  a buffet on the 6th level; and waiter service with  multi-courses on the 2nd level.     I especially like that the maitre d’s  at both restaurants organize a “share” table at meals which is wonderful for those on our own.  Services — Staff are 5-star in every wayExcursions — most of the cruises I’ve taken with Ponant have been expedition-type, so all excursions are included.   The Pacific trips were mainstream cruises.  On these  trips, however,   over half the excursions were included, We were also given snorkel equipment to use during the entire cruiseActivities — you won’t be bored - even on at-sea days.  I especially enjoyed the morning stretching class and the afternoon pool exercise class.  Get there early for the morning class to make sure you have a mat.   Organization —  whoever plans the excursions, activities,  concerts,etc. is superb.  Moving 200+ people on and off a ship to where they want to go  (touring, snorkeling, beach vsit, etc) is no easy feat.Price:  the larger discounts seem to be when the itineraries are announced.

To our dismay, the cruise was a disaster!  We had been told that the ship had been updated, which was untrue- water leaked Into and through the windows in our cabin and, in our friend’s luxury suite, it soaked the carpeting. Additionally, the meals were not up to Silver Seas standards and our expectations.We had to spend 2 days at sea due to weather and the inability to dock in our ports.  This was of course unavoidable, however there were no activities planned to occupy the passengers during this time.  OOn the final day of the cruise, staff indicated that a rope might have been caught in a propeller, so we could not dock as intended.  Passengers were told that their flights would be rescheduled as necessary and they would be notified.  We were notified 7 hours later that our flight was rescheduled for the following day (even though my husband had found a direct flight that would allow us to return that same evening), but staff indicated all changes had to be processed by staff in Miami. At 3pm we had still not received any information about debarkation, consequently we took our luggage to the lobby, only to find an area in total chaos with uninformed passengers waiting for lodging, flight and debarkation info.I was allowed to leave the ship, however my husband, directly behind me, was denied, saying there had been a change in plans.  I sat in a warehouse for 1 hour waiting with our luggage before he arrived.  Approximately 1/2 hr later a woman escorted us to a bus and told us they were taking us to a hotel.  It turned out to be a Westin.  We were dropped off and given a cab pass to reach the airport the next day.  There was no additional compensation for meals and other incidental expenses - we were on our own.  We did arrive home safely 24 hours later- fortunately our siitter was able to accommodate our change in plans.  BUT HERE IS THE DISTURBING PART!!!! UPON CALLING  SILVERSEAS TO DISCUSS MY CONCERNS I WAS TOLD BY THREE SEPARATE DEPARTMENTS AND 4 INDIVIDUALS THAT I COULD NOT DISCUSS MY CONCERNS WITH ANYONE………I WOULD HAVE TO WRITE A LETTER TO GUEST RELATIONS.  I complied with their request and wrote, indicating my concerns about their inability to manage passengers in emergency situations..among other cruise concerns. When I did not receive a call back as requested, I once, again contacted SilverSeas- I was told it took 4 to 6 weeks to receive a reply,  Yikes.  This week, 8 weeks after the cruise, I finally did receive a “cut and paste “ and condescending letter.  Summary: they would forward my concerns to the appropriate parties, and offered a mere $800 voucher (for two) on a future cruise! Have you priced a Silver Seas Cruise lately ???There was truly no interest in Silver Seas management learning about our unfortunate  experiences.I suggest you book on Regent!",Sail Date: October 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Canada|,

The storm had force 7 and the communication about the weather, plans to ease the movements etc and where we would sail was not enough.

Our expectations were totally set too high it seems or rather set at a level that the average cruise passenger would ""expect"". On boarding we were amazed at the luxury appearance of the ship and indeed we were excited and delighted to be on-board and then...1. Our cabin was superficially cleaned with a used bathrobe left in the closet, finger makers (not ours) on the cabin window, the dust on the furniture was more than evident and for someone who has hay fever it was very noticeable. The cabin, in fairness, was appropriate and functional. On closer inspection the cabin was tired, superficial repairs of cabin items, and utilities poorly maintained (toilet failed a few times).2. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner was rather impressive in terms of food choice and then...we found knives and forks with fingerprint marks, we found a few pieces of human hair in our porridge, some dishes served lukewarm only, whilst some dishes missing condiments as shown on the menu. The dress code was really joke with jackets for men at dinner being mandatory (really!).3. Staff were functional and friendly (perhaps too friendly) but then...we found that most of the staff (99%) were from Eastern Europe and unfortunately lacked the professional requirements of fine dining. Waiters saw their job as functional rather than 'service' oriented with a lack of understanding of the basics of table service with wines poured without asking, wines poured into glasses which had another wine type in it, wines poured to high levels, failure to have butter on the tables (we had to ask every time) and boot plated cleared which some guests were still eating at our table. The waiters were somewhat over friendly and at times making jokes at tables that were poorly delivered and/or un-welcome. Unfortunately their command of the English language was poor which created difficulties in ordering meals with variations.4. Excursions - these were all pre-planned and we were looking forward to our off-shore visits and then...various excursions were cancelled, two fundamental port calls were cancelled due to bad weather, whilst others were poorly organised with one off-shore visit requiring a 40 minute waiting in a queue.5. Entertainment was very good so a well done to the young cast. The scheduled 'Talks' were more like lectures rather than entertainment.6. Ship Announcements were daily and via speakers rather than in person which would have been better and more collegial allowing cruise passengers to mix and network.7. Weather was wonderful for most of the time and then...we encountered a few days of severe weather. Quite frankly we were of the view that the trip should have been delayed until the weather passed rather than proceeding sailing in storm seas - quite frightening really. Whilst bad weather is beyond the control of Silverseas the safety of passengers is more critical than keeping to schedule.In summary, we enjoyed the scenery, cruising on crisp and sunny days, and we also had a good social time thanks to the people we met on-board but we are unlikely to sail Silversea again.",Sail Date: October 2019|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: |Destination: United States|,"Sydney, Australia"

Perhaps the Cabins ( Suites as Silversea call them ) could do with some updating and I believe this is planned later this year before the Wind joins the Silversea Expedition Fleet.  Bathrooms are unbelievably small.  Small tub with shower over!One of the many joys of the Silver Wind is it size, with a Guest capacity of 296.  As one fellow Guest observed as we docked in a Caribbean Island mais Harbour, the entire Crew and Guest list could be accommodated in just one lifeboat af the Azure of the Seas docked alongside us and carrying over 5000 Guests!Service on the Ship was second to none.  Always a smile from the Crew and nothing too much trouble.  Food was of a high order and we especially enjoyed the Italian fare in the Terrazza.

We did have a on board credit to soften the pain of the cost!Not sure I would want to return to the Caribbean on a Cruise, as all the ports are litterally over run with cruise ships........many ports had 5 or 6 ships in dock, and due to their enormous size disgourging 15000/ 16000 people into the local facilities.",Sail Date: February 2019|Cabin Type: Suite|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Caribbean|,

We traveled with our kids 8 and 10 and just got home from an 8 night Mediterranean cruise onboard the Le Lyrial.  We LOVED this ship.  The staff were amazing, there was a kids club that I couldn't pull my kids from (more on that), and we were very pleased with the food.  Cabins:Cabins are adequate in size.  We have been on Royal Caribbean and Disney boats and the Deluxe Balcony stateroom was just as big, with a decent sized balcony.  We had cabins 323 and 325, both rooms were perfect for 2 ppl per cabin with plenty of storage.  They took out the balcony divider between out staterooms so we could come and go between the cabins.  These staterooms do not connect from the inside.Kids Club:There was a kids club on this cruise, which I don't think is offered on all the itineraries.  If there's a kids club, it will be listed. My kids loved kids club.  The activities they provided for the children were entertaining. No there is not a basketball court, or all the other kids stuff you find on the Disney and RC boats, but my kids never complained about not having that.  In fact, they told us this was the best kids club they've been too.   Port stops:Because this is a smaller boat, you port in smaller ports and getting off the boat is so much less stressful. Ponant organizes everything to a ""T"" and we were very impressed with the tours they provided. We generally do not book cruise ship tours, but these tours never had any more than 20 ppl in a group, again a BONUS being on a smaller boat.Food and Dining:Food was great!  There are 2 restaurants and we never had a problem getting seating at either of them. I do wish they had a couple more options for the included house wines.  With this being a french boat, I was looking forward to tasting some good french wines.  They do have them, but they come at a cost.  Pool Deck:Never crowed.  On a Mediterranean cruise one would have thought you would have problems finding a chair.  We never did.  Also, ppl do not reserve chairs with towels, which was nice!  There were 122 people onboard our ship.  Amazing!  I can't imagine we will ever be able to go back to a bigger boat after being on the Le Lyrial.  I would also like to add that our tour manager, Nina was phenomenal.  She organized all our excursions, and they went above and beyond to make sure we had the best experience possible.  For example, we booked an excursion that was not offered as an inclusion to the US passengers, and was given only in French. My husband and I knew this going into it. We fully expected that we were going on a French speaking excursion and were ok with that.  To our surprise, Nina had organized an English speaking guide to accommodate us that day.  It was like we had our on personal guide.  We did not expect this at all!  But again, this is Ponant, and Nina was just exceptional.  All in all we will book again with Ponant.  Not having to deal with the crowds on embarking and disembarking is so worth the extra cost!

When we arrived at Santiago airport it was extremely busy but there were plenty of team members from Silver Sea to guide us through the airport and send us off in our transfer to the Mandarin Oriental Hotel.  This is undergoing a refurbishment but all amenities were open and there was no disruption to their operations. Once we'd collected our itinerary, boarding passes etc. we spent a few hours by the pool before dining in the Senso restaurant with a few other couples who were also on the trip. Unfortunately, while the food looked great, one of our party had to send their steak back twice and another had under-cooked mussels which they also sent back. An early night ready for a 3am start and flight to Ushuaia on LATAM airlines.  The queues at the airport security were very long even at this time of the morning meaning almost an hour standing in one queue or another.  When we finally boarded the plane its pretty basic. Very little leg room, narrow seats and no chance of catching up on some sleep, but the scenery as you fly south is beautiful.  Look out for the snow capped volcanoes which are stunning.Once we landed in Ushuaia we were taken on a short sight seeing tour and then onto an Argentinian lamb BBQ.  I loved it, but not one for the vegetarians on the boat with only a pasta and tomato sauce alternative.   Back to the Silver Cloud and once on board it was first class food, drink and service all the way. Our butler ""JonJon"" made sure he stocked the bar with our favorite drinks and couldt do enough to help us with restaurant bookings and general info.The Expedition team were brilliant. Each a specialist in their own field but also a generalist on most thing Antarctica. No question was too trivial despite the fact they must have been asked it a thousand times before and they always had time to discuss the events of the day or plans for tomorrow.The daily briefings were very informative and helpful as well as numerous other lectures throughout the cruise to help make the whole expedition a full on experience and all the kit provided is first class.We were very lucky with the weather, experiencing just one day of 4m swells but experienced the Drake Lake on the outbound leg and minor swells on our return.All the restaurants on bvoard are first class. The main restaurant is first class, the Bar and Grill serves Burgers but its the steak and prawns on hot rocks that draws everyone.  La Dame is a beautiful French style restaurant which becomes all the more enchanting as you watch giant icebergs drift by, but i was a little disappointed with La Terrazza.  The menu didnt vary much and the buffet lunch could be a bit of a free for all, but the quality of food was again excellent.TIP - If you want to experience La Terazza, La Dame or The Grill, book them online in advance. You can always cancel up until 2pm on the day of the reservation and after the first day at sea La Dame and The Grill were fully booked for the week!Plenty of wildlife to see and we got phenomenally close to it all the the expert help of the Expedition Team.In the evening, there were quiz's & karaoke and plenty of space for everyone to get together with friends they have made on the trip and to catch up on the days events  sharing their stories and pictures.The final day saw us in our Zodiac boats, surrounded by Humpback Whales which came closer than I could have ever imagined and the chance to take the Antarctic Plunge which IS as cold as you think it will be but what an experience!This trip has me hooked on Expedition Tours and i'll definitely book another.",Sail Date: February 2020|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Antarctica|,"Cambridge, United Kingdom"

The Cloud is the oldest ship in the fleet but was recently remodeled and hardened to be an ice class ship.  Now with just over 200 passengers in the Antarctic it never seems crowded and the food and beverage options are all world class,  I had a wonderful experience with the Silver Sea expedition class ship in the Galapagos.  There the government places extreme restrictions on food that can be served and mandates local staffing.  The 27 expedition staff on Cloud were stellar but multiple restaurants and room service that were available for each meal and the staff comprised of well trained professionals from across the fleet created an over the top experience.  The cruise package starts with an overnight in Santiago at the Mandarin which is a beautiful and well located hotel still in the last stages of a renovation.  The next day starts at 3am for a charter flight to Ushuaia were you join the ship after a tour and lunch at a local restaurant.  We met our butler in our cabin where the boots, parka and other protective clothing was waiting and our bar was stocked with our favorites from previous cruises.  Both crossings of the Drake Passage were surprisingly uneventful.  It was one of many times that we appreciated the larger ship that had been outfitted with new and more powerful engines designed to preform  well in  Arctic conditions.  The two days of transit to Antarctica where filled with orientation meeting and a host of excellent lectures from the team on board. All of our Zodiac ""landings""involved stepping into knee deep water to get on shore. Each guide has years of experience and exhibited a profound appreciation for the region, the wild life  and the extreme beauty and tranquility we were experiencing. The ships captain , Eric Saint Plancat, found amazing locations for the excursions and even a good spot for satellite reception so that we could enjoy an ship wide Super Bowl party.  Perhaps one of the most memorable incidents occurred when the expedition staff spotted a large pod of Orcas.  The captain turned the ship and provided us with an unbelievable viewing of the pod teaching the younger members to hunt a seal.   A growing number of ships visit the Antarctic each season.  I highly recommend the Cloud for your trip.  By day you have amazing expedition experiences and at night you can experience fine French dinning in La 'Dame.

We recently took their 17 day cruise to Greenland, which turned out to be very disappointing.  The scenery was nice at first, but very monotonous after a few days.  If it weren't for the interesting shapes of the icebergs, there would have been nothing to photograph.  The villages on both the Canadian and Greenland side were uninteresting.  We had hoped to see wildlife but there almost no signs of anything living.  The one polar bear we saw was so far away that it couldn't be made out with the naked eye and the whale spouts were so far away they couldn't be seen either.  The most annoying thing was that the cruise director and expedition crew were constantly talking about what an incredible day we had.  Maybe riding in zodiacs in below freezing weather and getting soaked while seeing little of interest is exciting for some people, but definitely not for us.Our cabin was nice, but we experienced a flood along with several other cabins in our row.  No one attempted to help us with the damage we incurred and we were told that we were lucky since we had minimal damage and others had much worse.  The extent of their help was to put a large noisy fan inside our room for a couple of days.  Knowing that our cabin was probably going to be affected when it happened, they should have been proactive when they were working in the corridor all night with noisy equipment and warned us to remove items from the floor in the closet.  By the time we discovered the problem it was too late to save the things in our backpack, some of which were not replaceable.  We bought our own boots for wet landings and tagged them as instructed.  We wore them once and when we went to the mud room after a few days for another excursion we found that someone had helped themselves to one boot from each pair.  If you invest in your own boots it would be wise to clean them and keep them in your cabin at night.Already soured on the trip after these experiences, the final straw was the guest relations manager's rudeness.  Far from appeasing passengers who were upset her attitude actually caused us to cancel our already booked Kamchatka cruise and to not book the Antarctica cruise we planned to book while on board.  The food in the main dining room is mostly very good, although there were a few days with some big misses.  La Terrazza is good, but the menu choices don't offer much variety.  The disappoinment is La Dame, for which you pay $120.  It isn't worth the money.

A three week expedition cruise- and an amazing adventure. While this 'crossing' does not go into Antartcia directly it stops in various hard to reach places - like South Georgia and Tristan da Cunha. There is only one sailing each year! Entering our balcony cabin our pre ordered Parka (you get to keep it- the warmest , amazing Parka ever- I wish I had had this when we climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro in 2017!)  and the rented boots and water resistant pants, together with the gift of expedition water bottles and backpacks were already waiting for us- together with a welcome bottle of champagne. This is not a regular cruise- it is an expedition cruise, filled with lectures (no shows or other kind of entertainment) and amazing days out on the Zodiacs, surrounded by penguins, seals, sea elephants and well: Nature at it's best. Because there is such a restricted amount of ships and with that 'humans' that travel to these islands each year it is a once in a lifetime adventure- the animals are fearless, and the history behind these particular expeditions is simply fascinating. The sailing itinerary can slightly vary because the crew watches the weather very closely and sometimes it is impossible to anchor and go ashore in these remote islands. Nature dictates!Again- There is no entertainment on the ship other than lectures- however, the explorer team of experts is fun to be with, they are very knowlegdeable and each has a story to tell-they are  available on deck on sea days for bird - and whale-watching and sometimes just to share the odd  story or answer questions, help with photography issues etc, . Also, the crew is amazing on Silversea- I appreciate the fact that no gratuities are expected (on other cruiseslines it seems on top of the guests paying for the cruise they also have to pay for the staff so that they end up with a decent income, unfortunately) , it is up to you- but the staff is amazing, friendly , courteous, professional and everybody seems genuinely happy and proud the be part of the Silversea family. While the food in the main restaurant was good, but not as amazing as we are used to from former 'regular', non expedition cruises on Silversea, I want to mention the hot rock grill your own on the outside pool deck every evening- absolutely amazing!!Bottom line: If you 'are into nature' expedition cruising is the way to go- and Silversea is awesome!",Sail Date: March 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Antarctica|,"Las Vegas, Nevada"

My wife and I had  a wonderful 34-day cruise in spring 2019 from Capetown to Lisbon, stopping at 17 places in western Africa. Our suite was great, as were the staff and the public areas. Food ranged from good to very good, sometimes excellent. There were shortcomings. Three scheduled ports were dropped before we left because of security issues. People booking this cruise in the future need to know they may not get all the ports they paid for. Also, not all the ship excursions were well-run and supervised. And the enrichment speakers could have been better.The Ship. Built in 1994 and heavily refurbished in 2017, the Cloud looks like a real ship. It’s almost perfectly maintained.  Painters were frequently seen doing touch-ups, a sign of a well-run vessel. Suites have pleasant, usable balconies, two chairs, a sofa, a coffee table and a desk, and small but utilitarian bathrooms with a shower. Storage space was okay. We asked to have one chair removed, as it crowded the room and wasn’t needed, but the staff refused. Soundproofing between rooms was inadequate. Basic wifi was free and worked well most of the time. Air conditioning was okay. We had Room 622—a perfect location. The pool area had sufficient lounges, but one of the whirlpools was too cold and sometimes closed and complaints failed to correct the situation. The captain, Vincent Taillard, and the ship officers were cordial but standoffish. The social director, Moss Hills, was delightful. And quietly famous. Years ago, with another company, he helped lead the successful abandonment of a sinking cruise ship.The Food. We’re critical people, and we mostly enjoyed the meals. A few dishes seemed too edgy. The breakfast buffet could have used more variety. And, like seemingly all cruise ships, the Cloud featured awful frozen hash-brown potato patties. A reuben sandwich at lunch was terrible. How about some simple recognizable grilled sandwiches? Overall, we had good choices and found the food at least good and sometimes excellent. I had fillet mignon four times—really good each time. Wine and cocktails flowed freely. We enjoyed every glass of wine we drank, although we realize they don’t serve $40-a-bottle wine. Room service food was good. Waiters were good. The Restaurant, where you don’t need reservations, was the best. La Terrazza, which features Italian in the evening, lacked variety. The Grill, on the outdoor deck, features a grill-your-own meat on a hot volcanic rock. We went once. Never again. I guess some people like the concept. We don’t. Why not just have a good outdoor grill/barbecue? There is a specialty French restaurant that requires a steep extra charge.The Expedition. The Cloud fell short here. Admittedly the itinerary was ambitious, including places were many ships never go, in a difficult environment. We wanted to experience the sights and culture of west Africa first-hand. We did. Every port offered a least one shore excursion covered by the ship fare. Some were great. Some were okay. Some sadly lacking. Some didn’t deliver what was promised when we reserved. Guides were sometimes poor. Supervision from the ship expedition staff was too-frequently lacking. The expedition leader, Nicki D’Souza, was not up to the task. Silversea needs to hire people from Tauck to demonstrate how to run tours. We had one great speaker—a former top assistant to Nelson Mandela. But where were the black professors, journalists or politicians from west Africa? Not on our ship.Conclusion. We’re not sure we’d book the cruise again. It’s really expensive. The missed ports and the shaky shore excursions were irritating. We could and should have gotten more for our money. But we accomplished a lot of our goals and we learned and we had fun.",Sail Date: March 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Africa|,

Captain Todd McBain and his staff were great and for the most part, it was a smooth sailing through wind storms and high waves.  we missed Montevideo, our first stop after BA, due to high winds.  Falklands were mainly a stop to see birds and penguins.  the sailing around the cape and scenic cruising in and out of the various islands of the Antarctica peninsula were scenic and Princess had 3 naturalist lecturers on board.  scenery became a bit repetitious of glacier after glacier but we were fortunate to have 2 good sunny days to view the icy landscape practically devoid of whales, seals and penguins.we enjoyed naturalist Mark Harris the most and attended all his lectures about marine mammals, etc.  ""Alaska on steroids"" was his most common phrase to describe Antarctica.  Mark has a very positive view of life and we appreciated his humor and lively delivery of the various subjects such as sharks, turtles and penguins. we saw many glaciers and some impressive sized icebergs but no glaciers calving like in Alaska.  we felt that the remoteness of Antarctica is not really worth the money and flight time of 14 plus hours. unless one must see Antarctica, not having a chance to land on the continent is a quasi claim that we visited this continent.we had problems with our balcony room from day one with wind noises and air coming through the sliding balcony door.  the wind was forcing air through the fixed door and the sliding door.  we told our room steward and we did not get any response for over a day.  we called the front desk personally and at the end of the 2nd day and they finally sent maintenance staff to look at the problem.  he noted the problem and said that he has to return later.  he also noted that our room was cold.  we had set the thermostat to the highest setting but no heat came out.  maintenance told us to call front desk and ask also for HVAC repair.  now we have 2 issues of cold air coming in and no heat.maintenance came in the afternoon of the 3rd day and put weather seal around the top the door and about 3 inches down the side where the wind came in.  we experienced more wind storms on our way to the Falklands and the wind noise and air came in again but now lower than the previous location.  we asked for a maintenance manager to inspect the problem and he acted like this was a rare occurrence.  when the actual repair person came, he added 4 more inches of weather seal between the fixed and sliding doors.  this finally fixed the wind noise and air intrusion.  when we asked him about this type of repair, he said that he has to service 7 sliding doors that day the same way.  we were really disappointed on Princess' maintenance when the sliding doors for all balcony rooms would have this type of problem sooner or later.we normally enjoy eating in the main dining room for dinner, but Coral Princess's main dining food and menu were uninspired and we found eating in the buffet more enjoyable.  we did have one special dinner for new years' eve where they served 2 tasty lobster tails.  the afternoon tea between 3-4 is still very good and had excellent scones served with jam and cream.  one of the staff held 2 lessons in Spanish and we wished there were more.Princess stage performances were good and we had to arrive 30 minutes early just to get seats in a packed theater for the early performances.  the gym was equipped adequately and we used it 12 times over 16 days since there were only 4 ports for a 16-days cruise.  although it was start of summer down south, Antarctica was about 32-35 degrees Fahrenheit.  we had warmer temperatures in Chile.  embarking and disembarking were well done along with efficient tendering.Coral Princess and this particular cruise itinerary is at most a 3-1/2 stars.  interesting but not too satisfying for excitement, novelty and quality of food.",Sail Date: January 2020|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Antarctica|,

Martinique I advise everyone to book the Botanical gardens. Great long suspension bridges, so much nature arroud. Great place to visit. Days a sea we always enjoy. So much to keep you busy, or just relaxing. I enjoyed the Zumba classes fallow by some country dancing. Unfortunately our instructor had an injury not related with the class (Zumba)on the second day.

True, you could opt to go into town in Fairbanks or walk across the highway in Denali, but that was not always a desirable choice when exhausted from travel or having been out all day on excursion. It wasn't the worst, but we found choices limited and relatively pricey during this part of the trip. Maybe it was just us. Princess seamlessly handled every aspect of our tour. The train from Denali to Whittier was clean, comfortable and the domed cars offered amazing views. On the train near Anchorage, we were checked in for the cruise so when we arrived at the ship, we were given our sail cards and ready to go. It was refreshing to enter our cabin and find our luggage already waiting for us. The cruise on Coral Princess was very nice in every way. If you are looking for super high end, however, it was not.

We chose anytime dining in Bordeaux dining room and it was up and down food quality…choose the waiter’s recommendation.Seemed most of the food-particularly the meat and cooked veggies had been frozen, not fresh.The speciality restaurant we went to, Bayou Cafe was rather ordinary and being familiar with Cajun/Creole, the food did not resemble food from that region, although it was OK, not great.The service from start to finish was very good at the lodges, everyone was unfailingly helpful (other than 20,320) and on the ship for the most part good.  We had a super room steward - Teodoro Garcia -deserves recognition as does Rafael in the Bordeaux dining room.  On the ship we encountered language problems with some of the staff (particularly at the front desk!) not speaking or comprehending English very well.  Senka Jahic was particularly unhelpful and sarcastic.  Our ship room had a balcony and was generally nice.  Made for some great views of the glaciers.  The bathroom (our room was B-339) had a stench that we realized was sewer-like coming from the shower stall that was so small you couldn’t bend over.  We did our best to deal with it, closing the door to the bathroom.  The room had plenty of storage space, which was nice, at the sacrifice of the shower stall.Overall, we liked the tour, enjoyed seeing everything about Alaska we saw…book as many excursions as you can handle.  Giving this overall three stars because of the cruise ship room and the food issues.Also, the Coral Princess is rather dated and needs a remodeling…and the bathrooms. If you go on the cruise ship and are a foodie, lower your expectations and focus on enjoying Alaska. If we had to do it again, we’d probably choose a smaller ship (2,000 or so on this ship) and pay a little more for better food.  Three star overall out of five, but we VERY MUCH LOVED seeing Alaska and did not let the shortfalls disappoint the experience for us.  Great trip, just not Princess again for us.",Sail Date: August 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Alaska|,"Fort Collins, Colorado"

Voyage of the glaciers southbound!,"We chose the Coral Princess because of its small size and the itinerary it provides for viewing both Hubbard Glacier and glacier bay! Southbound especially. Those coming North had less glacier time and didn’t have energy left to deal with daily transfers. The smaller boats do get very close to Hubbard glacier and that was by far the best part of the journey.The small boat also handled its crowd well. There are much bigger ships but we heard complaints from those on the bigger boats with long lines for dinners (even with fixed dining schedules) , crowds in port, etc.Highest marks to princess on their Logistics. They were spot on and organized to the T! Every transfer was so well done throughout the land and ocean voyage excursions. Boarding and off boarding were efficient and usually right on schedule and often ahead of schedule.Lowest marks were on the Fairbanks princess lodge. It needs some serious updating.Lesson learned-you should opt for multiple nights in Denali at each hotel and not the single night transfers. You need full days to fit in the longer excursions or you won’t see the mountain (due to clouds) or you won’t see the animals (that are mostly further into the park). The standard package doesn’t give you enough time.Food in general was very good but repetitive. Salads were either not available or flavorless and watery. But Meat dishes and seafood were plentiful and excellent. Only disappointment was the lobster imported from Brazil. Otherwise ate every seafood option available and loved it all. Pizza and basics were plentiful during the day but at night this boat shuts down and goes to sleep (by 10:30pm). This is not a party boat and had little for the kids to do. It was mostly elderly with a fair mix of mid 40’s to 60’s there for fishing , wildlife and glacier excursions.There was plenty of live music throughout the cruise in the bars and atrium and it was good quality. The whale watching was spectacular throughout.A plus - the boat is well lit at night.A con - the boat is well lit at night.No nighttime stargazing to view the Milky Way or Aurora , lights stay on at all levels all night on all decks and in every spot of the ship.We saw a few game shows that were funny and Voice of the Ocean was great. We couldn’t attend many other shows due to our excursions.Suggest you do the any time dining as fixed dining proved to be a challenge for us.If your goal is to get the most out of Alaska and not what I hear a traditional cruise provides for partying, shows and drinking - I highly recommend the Voyage of the Glaciers Southbound.This was our first cruise and a very different style of vacationing than we are used to- but we absolutely loved it.",Sail Date: August 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Alaska|,

However, I have a real problem with the condition of the ship as well as their policy regarding  price matching for excursions.  I believe it to be deceptive advertising and feel as if our family of five had been ""taken.""  When I was planning excursions I saw that they have a ""Best Price Guarantee"" policy for excursions.  In order to take advantage of this ""Best Price"" we had to pay up front then submit the request form stating the name of the company that offered a lower price for the excursion, which I did.  Long story short, We contacted TWO Guest Services desks while on the cruise then were told they never received the faxed request (for which we have the OKd Fax Transaction print out).   Then they said we had to call Princess once we got home.   We did that and have been given the run around three days in a row.  Also, Princess has started ""nickel and diming"" the guests, having us pay for bottles of water, drinks at mealtime, etc.  This is my second Princess Cruise (the first one was great).   It is also my last.   So - let the buyer beware and don't book with Princess.  Pay a bit more for good, full service on a ship that isn't outdated, rusted, and doesn't have mildew on the balconies!I don't know what has happened with Princess but my husband had a conversation with  a friend when we returned from our cruise and the friend said exactly the same thing as we.  He, too, has taken his last Princess Cruise.

The tiles in the bathroom were in bad shape and had discoloration in the molding.  The worst part was our balcony where we spent a lot of time watching the beautiful scenery and the glaciers.  The metal edges were very rusted and were obviously painted over and over with thick rust.  The glass which you would look through if seated on the balcony was dirty and damaged making it impossible to enjoy the view unless you stood up.  After paying a lot extra for a mini-suite, I was very disappointed with this room C503.  The food was also not comparable to other cruise lines which I have tried.

This review is about the ship, not the overall cruise/experience.We had a beautiful room with a balcony and comfortable beds. The bathroom was small, as expected with a cruise ship, and it was difficult to maneuver well enough to shave my legs. That being said, the room was nice, and it was evident that the Coral Princess is an older ship.My biggest complaint comes from the activities on board, or lack thereof. There were very few options for activities on board the ship unless you wanted to play trivia four or five times a day. During our at sea days, this was especially evident, and we found ourselves going a bit stir crazy. The cruise staff was very lackluster. The cruise staff: Brenna, Robbie, Danni and Sam were visibly bored with the trip and the clientele, which I understand given that they are on the trip over and over again. Still, I felt like there was not enough variety in the hosted activities. These guys were run ragged, and each activity lasted about 45 minutes, and it was always music trivia and Bingo.One day, there was a Wii with bowling, which was enjoyable. There was a day of stargazing in the Universe Lounge, but Robbie was not proficient enough with the computer program to make this enjoyable. I never saw the Wii again or karaoke after the brief period of time that they were done. The gameshows were not well executed either.The shows were good, except the magician bordered on being creepy with his tricks and jokes. While this post probably seems entirely negative, it is not. We enjoyed the trip immensely, but for the money we paid, it was disappointing to see the cruise staff so unenthused.

LF NEVER forwarded the suitcase despite many promises to do so. I even offered to go by taxi to the Panama airport to pick up the suitcase if LF would just send it. A Princess cruise representative phoned LF multiple times, instructing LF to put the suitcase on an American Airlines flight to Cartagena, Columbia and the suitcase would be delivered directly to the ship by the airline. LF declined to forward the suitcase no matter how many options they were given to do so. The suitcase contained over $7,000. worth of clothing including evening gowns, shoes & other items purchased exclusively for the cruise. Because of that loss, my @ $16,000. cruise was ruined. What my family was put through was a nightmare. The only clothing I had was the clothing I wore to board the ship. For three weeks I had no underwear, nightgowns, shoes, casual clothes, or evening wear for the four formal holiday dinners onboard. I spent our valuable vacation time washing clothes in the ship’s laundromat. I was forced to purchase over $2,500. worth of items on board the ship at incredibly inflated prices. I had no choice of where to buy items I  needed just to exist thru this emergency situation, as the only place to shop was the ship’s “boutique”. After many conversations with Luggage Forward, the company did reimburse the cost of the luggage transportation from Houston to Ft. Lauderdale, and offered an “apology”. LF admitted they failed to deliver as per their written guarantee. But LF will not reimburse any other expenses unless I agree to sign a non-disclosure agreement. I am not obligated or willing to be forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement.  LF asked for my receipts for items purchased because of the untenable position they put my family in. I faxed @ $2,200. in written receipts. I pointed out this was only a small portion of our loss, due to the time and money lost having to wash clothes every day instead of being able to enjoy the shipboard actives that I had paid for in our cruise fare. The amount of stress caused by LF’s failure to deliver the suitcase as guaranteed negated the very reason for the “vacation”. The company has not offered reimbursement for the $2,220 I was forced to spend. Why did LF ask for receipts they have NOT reimbursed? Instead LF offered an insulting $700. settlement, which would not even pay for the costs incurred having to contact LF over and over again. All calls to LF were “international calling” charges and using internet on the ship to contact LF cost $200. While no monetary amount could make up for the loss, $10,000. would be a reasonable reimbursement for what I was put though by LF’s incompetence.

There are no words adequate to describe this trip.The ship is great, not too big, not too small, so even in rougher seas, it does pretty well but small enough to do landings and see a lot.  Some of the amenities are over the top (butlers, sit down dinner service, superb chef and sommelier), but the expedition team was outstanding and it's unlikely you would get such a fantastic group on some of the lower key ships.  The all suite ship does have smaller and larger cabins, we were in mid-ship which was a good idea when it got rough (lower is better), The food and service is amazing not least the wait staff who had superb balance and a sense of humor, the staff gets to go on some of the landings and zodiacs to experience where we are, which I liked.  I also got my hair cut by a really good stylist (Madeline),  and a facial from the super masseuse/cosmetologist (Megan, also a fabulous entertainer with a great voice).  And they were really nice people, everyone was just super nice and friendly and seemed to like where they were working.The trip is incredible: Black browed Albatrosses and Rockhopper penguins nesting in West point, Falkland Islands, unbelieveable colonies of beautiful King penguins and their funny large brown chicks alongside fur seals and elephant seals in South Georgia, elephant seals and Macaroni and Gentoo penguins so numerous we could not even land but saw by zodiac on Elephant Island in two locations, the truly awesome Gerlache strait, Antarctic Sound and the Peninsula, with Adelie and Gentoo penguins nesting, alongside molting elephant seals, leopard seals, tons of whales including Humpbacks, Minkes, Fin, Southern Rights and Orca.  And finally South Shetlands with nesting Chinstrap colonies.  And then the Drake passage, which well, could have been worse but for the masterful sailing.  The crew under the capable Captain Andrey Domanin, showed their experience often, including when leaving the Antarctic Sound and having to push aside icebergs to get out of the Sound, not least sailing to and from South Georgia and through the Drake passage.  And nearly always, various birds around the ship including albatrosses, other petrels, terns and in the water penguins elegantly swimming and jumping through the water.The expedition team was fantastic, including Robin Aiello-the first woman to dive in Antarctica, Damien Sanders who spent years at the South Georgia research station and gave us the history, especially of the Shackleton expedition, Malcolm Turner who oversaw research on the Great Barrier Reef and is an experienced and knowledgeable ornithologist who also gave the climate change lecture (which was still questioned by some passengers), Ffion Rees, marine biologist whose whale lecture ended with a whale sighting, geologist James Lowe on the underwater and visible geology and volcanic and plate activity, Stephan Hauke, meteorology and sailing expert, Scott Kiefer, conservationist and last but not least, Luke Kenny the amazing and patient expedition leader whose announcements often were our alarm clocks and also had experience in the ""neighborhood"", and his capable staff, assistant Darryn Griffiths, coordinator Leonie Vieth, staffer Tania Jeken, photographer Ross McDonald.  All these people were incredibly knowledgeable, approachable, very nice, and quite funny.  Super story tellers who could and did make fun of themselves at times.This was our 40th wedding anniversary and also we had Christmas and New Years.  All great fun.  We did have the unfortunate experience of having to visit the doctor when an unfortunate accident with the wind ripped my husband's finger and both Dr. (Frans) and nurse (Angel) were super nice and very professional.  Luckily we did not have to get flown out as the injury was manageable with stitches and it happened on days at sea and early enough to allow him to wear gloves later on.  But it underscored the need for insurance to cover emergency flights and care.Biosecurity was taken very seriously to keep the environment pristine, which meant scrubbing boots, having all outer gear examined and cleaned.  We rented waterproof pants and boots which were delivered to our room and luckily fit and we and most people, wore the Silversea parkas so a sea of red jackets were often in view but helped us see how far the zodiacs actually were going for the expeditions.I could go on endlessly as this was the best trip I've ever taken and I was lucky enough to be able to do this.  It is expensive, but truly the trip of a lifetime.  I had no idea about South Georgia but so glad we went there so I would highly recommend this loop.  I wish I could do it again... perhaps I will.  And if you don't take climate change seriously, seeing pictures of the glaciers from the experienced staff's slides and how they have receded may change your mind and make you think twice about what you should support.

Silversea has utterly failed to meet its responsibility to its customers.In March of 2018 my wife and I purchased a cruise with Silversea from Bali Indonesia to Darwin Australia. By paying in full for the cruise one year in advance our contract with Silversea included round-trip airfare from Newark. We arrived at the airport at the appropriate time to find that our flight on Cathay Pacific to Hong Kong connecting to Bali was canceled.  We were told to return the next morning and that we were protected on a flight on United Airlines to Bali through Shanghai. As I was unable to confirm our seats online that evening, we returned to Newark airport early and again were unable to confirm our flight. United Airlines personnel were also unable to confirm our flight whereupon we were transferred to the “special help” line. After half an hour with the airline agent and subsequent calls between the agent and our travel agent, neither United nor our travel agent were able to contact Cathay Pacific *nor Silversea emergency help desk. Half an hour before the flight we were given two choices, miss the flight or pay $4000 for two “day of travel” tickets to Bali.*I was able to contact the Silversea after hours team but they were unable to resolve the problem.We paid the $4000. Our contract with Silversea also included trip interruption insurance.Upon return our travel agent contacted Silversea for reimbursement of the $4000 that we were charged for our trip to Bali.  Our travel agent has been in telephone and email contact with the Silversea representative, DeAnn Koehler for over five months to no avail. Ms. Koehler is absolutely unresponsive other than to say that she is taking care of it. We have not seen any “taking care”.We have now paid $4000 for airfare that Silversea was to include in our contract. We also missed a day of our trip in Bali. It appears at this point we have no choice but to litigate against Silversea to recover the money that we were required to pay to begin our excursion.

Lots of beach time. Snorkeling and lectures on the flora and fauna in the area.   The ship is old.    While kept in perfect condition this ship is slated to be retired in July of 2019 and replaced with a new one so while I have a few issues with it such as funny tasting water and finicky A/C, this ship will not be part of the Silversas fleet in a month.  The important Hong is that Silvers as is a t notch.

As we're getting on a bit, we wondered a bit about how we would cope hopping into and out of Zodiacs from the side of the ship, or beach landings, but the crew were so good we had very few issues and those were minor.Everything ran like clockwork, given the vagaries of winds and tides, and we saw some wonderful sights of glaciers, mountains, birds and animals. One real highlight was our visit to the Torre del Paine National Park. This is possibly one of the most beautiful places on earth! Completely natural, just breathtaking scenery and amazing fauna and flora.There were just two downsides, neither of which were directly attributable to Silver seas. On our last day at sea, we had been out whale-watching and were coming in to get some coffee when the ship lurched rather suddenly and my wife fell and hurt her back. There should have been a handrail along that small corridor, and the ship's officers who attended to her said they would get that done. Hopefully it has been. But on a small ship out in the Pacific Ocean it isn't all going to be smooth sailing, so we have no animosity because of this. She has recovered, though it took some time and her injury did mean that our travel back home was more difficult, although we had upgraded to business class flights, and just as well!The second was the check-in at the Sheraton in Santiago. This was arranged by a local agent with the hotel, and frankly it was a shambles. There were a lot of people to check in, but there was no pre-processing, no keys prepared, and so it too us close to 90 minutes before we had a room, which even then wasn't ready until later.But these things fade into insignificance compared with e sights we saw, the service we received, and the memories we retain.Silverseas are a premium brand, so relatively expensive, but for our money are one of the best, but if you are thinking of travelling with them, do book early and take advantage of every discount you can!",Sail Date: February 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: South America|,"Chinnor, United Kingdom"

Positives of the small ship included getting to know other passengers and staff. Negatives were lack of facilites: only one main restaurant and a deck cafe-style dining area; no cafes, only one tiny shop, no evening entertainment.

Everyday we spent 2 lots of 3 hours 'on the ice' with an experienced guide.  The wildlife was abundant and everyday there were lectures from experts in every field from birdlife, seals, penguins, whales, and the geology and land itself.  Nothing was too much trouble and attention to detail was extraordinary.  We chose a 'small ship experience' deliberately - 150 passengers and the same number of staff.  The Captain and all the Officers mixed freely and there was none of the 'Captain's Table' nonsense that you experience on large cruise ships.  The Captain sat wherever he could get a seat and mixed freely with all passengers. We would highly recommend this experience without reservation.

Only 684 guests. Boarding the ship was super easy, no big 3,000+ people crowds.We had a balcony cabin aft 8106. The balcony cabins on this ship are small, so are the balconies. This is because of the size of the ship.  But, they are well appointed.If you can swing the extra bucks, get a PH class cabin one deck above.  They are much bigger.  We had this PH Penthouse Balcony type of cabin on Oceania cruises, which has the exact same R-Class ships (They made eight of these R-Class ships in France).  The PH class balcony cabins have a lot more room - bigger everything. Our cruise was 14-days over Christmas and New Years from Ft. Lauderdale, FL. It stopped at 9 ports.  This was a great itinerary.  The ship stops at islands the big cruise ships cannot access - Like St. John’s, Virgin Gorda, Tobago, the Grenadines.The service on this ship is wonderful because the crew has less people to accommodate. All super-friendly too!  It is easy to get around on this ship because of its size.Don’t expect a high-tech, high excitement experience on the Pacific Princess.  It is a low-key kinda cruise experience. Not like Carnival or NCL.  More for adults. No rock climbing, go-carts, roller coasters, etc. The food was excellent. Great selections, and they can even do a bit of customization on your meal - e.g. if you want a different vegetable for example.  All the servers were great, and we had fun at dinner each night. Only one night of dancing waiters.  Not like on Carnival when it seems to happen nightly. We also ate at both of the special restaurants - Sabatini's and the Steak House. We def loved Sabatini's best. The bartenders were great too. They knew our favorites on the second night. All the people we met onboard were nice. We were surprised at the great entertainment for such a small ship. Very nice full-production shows, live band, great costumes and lighting effects.  They also had some off-beat acts - like a speed-painter, a singing magician, etc.  A lot of fun.

There were several highlights during this cruise, from surprise afternoon drinks on a sand island to a special event where we were entertained on the back deck (with more champagne) after meeting the Captain and staff. The sun was setting on the orange cliffs of the bay, one of the entertainers sang pieces from various popular operas which seemed to attract a pod of dolphins at that moment. A totally magical experience. However the best part of the cruise was the sometimes twice daily zodiac expeditions on various rivers and landing where possible on secluded beaches. The extensive team of qualified scientists acted as zodiac drivers and guides explaining the wildlife and rock art we were viewing and the amazing geology of the region. All the guides had years of experience in this region and also gave informative presentations each afternoon.

Much of the French cuisine really didn’t suit us.  The bacon was hard and absolutely dreadful.  I still have sore gums from chewing it.- Nylon brush bristles in mushroom soup one evening, our table and the adjacent table and another diner who ate the bristles thinking it was celery - no apology or offer of an alternative.- The shore excursion Ponant staff that accompany the trips seem oblivious to their inaptitude and need some serious training in hospitality.  Some examples:       -  a single long bench seat with shade at a view point fully occupied by Ponant staff and elderly guests left to stand out in the sun.       -  on a boat tour to a beach, the tour operator asks us to swim ashore or use a canoe because there were other boats filling the available beach space.  The boat was full of elderly people but the Ponant staff member said and did nothing.  I refused several times on behalf of the passengers and eventually got them to move another boat on shore to make way for us.  15 mins out of our 45 mins stop wasted.      -  another boat’s passengers were told that the canoes at a stop had to be paid for and the Ponant staff didn’t know that they were included.  That boat voted to go somewhere else and they missed out on a visit by canoe to the most beautiful hidden lagoon.      -  on two occasions we had to wait for the Ponant staff at the end of a tour stop as they were too busy chatting to their friends.  Everyone was there but the Ponant staff.  There was much talk about the poor performance of these staff amongst a number of the passengers.- we heard various stories of rude bar staff and experienced directly one occasion where the staff were outside at the handrail on entry to Hong Kong and my wife asked them to make a little space for her and she was rudely told this area was not for guests.  In fact it was usually not for guests but opened up for guests during the harbour entry and was full of guests.  Eventually they went off in a huff.-  Where was the piano player?  A beautiful grand piano with no one playing it.  Not good and was really needed to support the singers.- We were rudely awoken with room service breakfast ordered by another cabin. The passenger had mistakenly written our cabin number on their order but their correct name.  Surely the hospitality staff should cross check names. Not good.Out of 14 cruises and 8 cruise companies this was close to being our worst experience.  That’s not to say we didn’t have a good time, we did, but it should have been so much better.Sorry to say, 5 out of 10.",Sail Date: September 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Asia|,"Sydney, Australia"

They will only meet and transfer you to the ship if you arrive on their booked flight from Paris. If on a different flight, you must wait for the Paris flight in order to be met and transferred to the ship. Really! Not everyone lives or flies from Paris.2. The older ships have both an informal grill and formal restaurant. The newer ships have only the formal restaurant. We like having the choice.3. The cruises are focused on a French speaking experience. For example, while there are lectures in English, many of the interesting lectures are only in French. The vast majority of the passengers are French. The ships only have about 230 passengers. So if one of your things is meeting new friends, you probably need to speak French.And doctor’s hours are few and not dependable.No cruise is perfect, but Ponant should fix the meet and transfer to the ship process and have equal lectures in both French and English.",Sail Date: May 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Friends|Destination: South Pacific|,"Los Gatos, California"

They just let it leak all over the carpet which caused a horrible mildew smell. The same thing occurred on deck 2 near BB King’s lounge. Group bingo and trivia events were held in the small overcrowded billboard onboard. They literally had to take the chairs from the casino and there was still not enough. Then they had guests complaining in the lounge and casino about seating. The biggest issue with this was that just down the hall the main stage was open and had plenty of seating for these events. Also, housekeeping took our chair and blow dryer out of our room one day. We asked for them back but it took two days to get.  Lido deck also had rust and stalactites forming on ceiling which is a good indication the leaks have been a problem for some time.

With 300 kids on board, one would think more of an effort would be made to entertain them.6. Staff did not change duvet covers even if they were stained.

Boring ship.,"In June 2018, my husband and I took an Alaskan cruise on HAL's Eurodam. We really enjoyed that experience and wanted to repeat it. For our May 2019 cruise on the Oosterdam, we got a good price with discounted airfare through HAL. We were even able to upgrade from an inside cabin to a balcony for a small fee. Before the cruise, we spent 3 nights at an Airbnb in Seattle's Magnolia neighborhood. We had a fantastic time visiting the Ballard Locks and Discovery Park! This is a very walkable area, and it's tucked away from the downtown tourists. Also, it was a short drive to Pier 91. My feelings for this cruise were mixed, so I will divide my thoughts between pros and cons.PROS~ The ports (Juneau, Sitka, Ketchikan, and Victoria) were all fantastic!~ There is only one designated smoking area, and it is located outside at the back of deck 9. For a nonsmoker, this was truly a breath of fresh air!~ Our room was wonderful, and our stewards were excellent.~ The fresh floral arrangements found throughout the ship are gorgeous.~ We absolutely loved Lincoln Center Stage! On our previous cruise, we went to a few concerts. The musicians on the Oosterdam were even better. Besides being talented, they had a special chemistry that made their concerts extra special.~ We enjoyed the food. There was decent variety, and waiters were able to accommodate special requests. For some meals, we pre-ordered from the vegetarian menu. The fruit selection in the buffet was great for a cruise (apples, bananas, oranges, plums, kiwis, peaches, nectarines, pineapple, melons, berries).~ Each evening, there were a variety of drink specials (BOGO for $2, $5 wines, $4 cocktail samples). These are definitely a good value.~ Each morning, we had room service breakfast. Unlike many other major cruise lines, HAL still offers hot breakfast items on their complimentary menu. Also, we would request other items not listed on the menu (e.g. grapefruit, plain yogurt), and these items were always included. Orders arrived on time, and it was relaxing to start each morning with breakfast in our room.~ We did have one small issue with room service. One morning, the wrong omelet was delivered, and we did not discover the mistake until after the waiter left. I quickly fixed the situation by running up to the buffet and getting a new omelet. Later that day, I told guest services about what happened because I wanted to ensure future orders would be correct. To my surprise, we were sent a bottle of sparkling wine and chocolate covered strawberries. This was a small mistake, and HAL did a great job making up for it. Kudos for great customer service!~ The Promenade deck was a nice place for walking. Even on rainy or misty days, we were able to enjoy long walks outside.~ We liked the daily newspapers and puzzles provided each day on deck 1.CONS~ Entertainment was lacking. Each evening, we would find ourselves wandering around after dinner without anything to do. We don't go to the main shows in the theater. We prefer listening to bands in lounges and dancing. Lincoln Center Stage ends rather early. BB King has talented musicians, but their venue is small and has a poor layout. It felt more like a concert than a dance club. Most nights, very few dancers came out on the floor. There was very little energy and excitement at night.~ The atrium is tiny and dull. For me, the atrium should be the heart of the ship, but this area is lackluster and often deserted.~ This is a small ship. When the weather was cold, the ship felt even smaller. There were very few public areas and most of them were clustered together.~ During the day, there are not many scheduled activities. Computer workshops and cooking demos don't interest me. I prefer more active things, such as dance classes.~ We did freestyle dining, and we usually went to the dining room between 7 and 8pm. I was surprised at the first set dining time. 5pm seems entirely too early. Since so many people were eating during the cocktail hour, it made time before dinner dull too.~ The dress code is not enforced at dinner. On Gala Night, I saw people in t-shirts and guys wearing baseball caps.~ The ports were wonderful, and Hubbard Glacier was awesome! However, the timing in most of the ports is odd. The all aboard for Ketchikan was 12:30pm, and we weren't allowed off the ship in Victoria until after 6:30pm. These short stops make it difficult to fully enjoy these ports.~ The excursion prices are ridiculously expensive. We planned ahead and did our own thing in each port. If the excursions had been more reasonably prices, we might have gone on one or two.Overall, we enjoyed the cruise because the ports are beautiful and interesting. Shipboard life, on the other hand, proved a little too boring for us. We would consider HAL again if the itinerary is port intensive. If we do an Alaskan cruise again, we will try another line.",Sail Date: May 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Alaska|,Texas

We were in Stateroom #5185.(this was an upgrade from our original balcony cabin)  This ship is very similar to the Eurodam, which we were on to Alaska in June.  My one worry was that it would be super hot on the ship (Mexico was in the 90's) but this was not a problem at all.  Our room was very comfortable.  The entertainment was good, we love the Lincoln Center Stage and the talented young artists they provide.  I think we went to all but 2 of their concerts.  Our food was good...we had a table for 2 in the main dining room and our neighbors were a cute family of 4 and very friendly.  We went to 2 wine tastings on board and they were both really knowledgeable and the food pairings were perfect.  All of the staff on board are really friendly and work so hard.  Give them some cash $ for their hard work and they are so appreciative.  We got room service most mornings, especially on port days.  The Club Orange gave us priority tender boarding so this was easy.  The private tour of the kitchen was really interesting.  We had dinner at the Pinnacle Grill one night and it was worth it.

No interest in sitting in a cabin when there are lots of great places to sit inside and out around the boat.  The cabin was plenty big enough for 7 days.  The issue was that the toilets wouldn't flush the first day.  That got repaired relatively quickly, but then we had cold to barely lukewarm water in the shower in both our rooms until the last day.

Crew was very friendly especially the stateroom stewards and the food servers.  Balcony stateroom was comfortable with a sitting area and small balcony with two chairs. Really enjoyed the balcony on day we were viewing the glacier (could hear narration through TV).  Had issue with AC blowing all the time the first night.  Mentioned it to stewards and someone from ship was there soon after and it was fixed.  Didn't fully understand the dining situation.  We had open dining which worked well.  For the dining room we went about 1/2 hour before seating started and usually got a table right away. Dining room was nice, fancier meals.  Sometimes quantity was smaller, but always good.  Dinner on 2nd gala night was especially nice.  Breakfast and lunch usually in the buffet, which can get chaotic.  Wished we had one more breakfasts in the dining room.  First day didn't know we didn't need to check in for buffet.  So if it is your first cruise like us, just get food and find a table (which can be very difficult).  We did room service breakfast one morning which we enjoyed.  Ports were Juneau, Sitka, Ketchikan and Victoria.  Liked Sitka the best.  We didn't do an excursion and felt like there were good shopping and non-shopping things to do within walking distance (we walked over 4 miles that day).  Victoria was least favorite; got there in evening and shuttle took us to downtown (dark when we got there) where about all we found to do was shop (Chinatown was disappointing).  Our favorite on-board activities were the cooking demonstrations, trivia contests, line dancing lessons and the piano lounge (piano guys were especially good during the request show).  I was excited about the BB King blues club, but as a BB King fan I was disappointed it wasn't really blues but the music was more for a dance crowd (understandable).  Enjoyed walking on the deck and saw some dolphins one morning.  Fitness center was adequate.

We really did have a nice time but I do wish we had chosen a different ship. The Oosterdam is a bit outdated and isn’t a pretty ship at all. I almost felt like we were in a dungeon unless we were specifically by a window. There were only 2 overpriced shops, very few places to hide, and nothing glamorous about the ship at all. I realize that an Alaskan cruise caters to an older crowd but I would think that even an older crowd would like a nicer ship. Also, the ship made 5 stops and 2 of them were so rushed it was hardly worth the stop. I would rather have had less stops and more time to see the town, than more stops with less time. With that being said, I would like to say that the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Our cleaning staff (Hans and Anggiat), Lido dining attendant (Sendy), and the amazing BB King Blues Band (Angelique) and the gang were all amazing. They made the trip very enjoyable. And the captain and cruiser director, Valerie kept everyone informed. We had a pretty good cabin, 8015 (starboard) with a balcony, closer to the bow, and 2 floors below the observation room. Nice to step outside but too cold to sit. Only a salon and exercise room was directly above us. Very little hallway noise or noise from neighbors.

Our suite was incredible.  It had a comfortable King sized bed and a pull-out queen for the kiddos.  The bathroom was large with both a tub and shower stall.  The closet space was awesome too. The room was large enough for my family of 4, and the perk of the Neptune Lounge was great for getting light snacks throughout the day.  Our room stewards were great as well, but that's where the positives stop.  The food on the ship was sub par - from the buffet, to the dining rooms, to the specialty restaurants.  Many times, we waited 40 minutes or more to eat.  When the food would arrive, most of it would be lukewarm or even cold.  So disappointing. My kids (ages 12 and 9) were super excited about the kids' club, but after the first day - when they were placed in the same room with the toddlers, they never wanted to go back.  I wrote a complaint on the ship, and they responded with news of being short staffed and not expecting so many children on board.  I found that hard to believe because people typically book cruises months ahead of time.  With the exception of BB Kings (there was an awesome RnB Band playing during our trip), entertainment was a bust.  Thankfully the game room was well stocked and we could play family board games. There was only one small pool - and parents did not supervise their children so the pool wasn't relaxing whatsoever.  I wasn't impressed with shopping either.  I think we'd entertain the idea of traveling with Holland America again, but not on this ship.

Further, steak sliced open to see if done. I think going to a show and being seated behind a support column is not ok. When we arrived at their private island, we were told there would be no water due to repairs on board. We thus went to their island where we were served the same beverages , even water, by the same bar staff and were charged for it even though we paid for an expensive drinks package. The ship, other than our cabin was dirty. I have much more to report. The cruise line reported that the other passengers didn’t find things lacking.

When we asked for the “service fees” to be returned, we didn’t get it on ship and practically had to beg to have any if it returned. For the staff named above and a couple of others, we tipped very well because their performance was so superior as compared to others.

We decided to splurge on a large corner balcony suite and book them an inside non-windowed stateroom which worked out perfectly!  They were just a few rooms down and were able to come into our suite and hang out on our large balcony whenever they wanted.  The suite was very large with a king sized bed, desk, inside sitting area and huge wraparound balcony and a master-bedroom style bath with two sinks and a little dressing area. Even had four heavy wool blankets for sitting outside when the wind got a bit chilly. Exceeded our expectations!  Service:  The staff was wonderful!  Servicing our suite were Kiry and unfortunately I can't remember the woman's name but they were both very sweet.  They knew our names immediately and were always at our beck and call. We loved the fact that we could order room service breakfast every day at no extra charge. However we found out later that there was a $15 per person charge every day for service and cleaning.  Would have rather had that just rolled into our overall price. That said, they were great and left us little towel animals on our bed every night!  Overall the ship seemed very clean and lots of service staff around.The wifi, which you have to pay for, is TERRIBLE. We negotiated a credit because it was so bad. Maybe cannot be improved but if that's the case don't charge for it.Food:  Overall I would compare it to decent hotel food.  We tried to avoid the Lido Market open buffet except for lunch or snacks, but it seemed OK and the salad bar was decent. I liked the fact that they put your salad together for you and it wasn't open with everyone doing it themselves. The Dining Room options were generally good, however definitely reserve as soon as you board; some nights that was challenging.  They also tried to sell you entrees for an upcharge; we did not try any of those.  We did go to the restaurants Pinnacle Grill and the Italian one Canaletto for an upcharge.  Pinnacle Grill we would do again, the other one seemed to have some of the same pasta as in the Lido just with table service (it's in a corner of the Lido).Ports:  We had a great excursion in Juneau which stopped at Mendenhall Glacier, then whale watching and lunch at a bayside lodge. Lunch was pretty basic but the the salmon was so fresh and wonderful!  The bay is where they film the show Deadliest Catch.  We were blessed with beautiful weather which of course makes all the difference; we did see some humpback whales and overall enjoyed the whole experience.  We also did a wildlife excursion in Sitka which was fun and in Ketchikan opted to stay in town and just go to the Lumberjack Show (corny but fun).  FYI the ship spends a whole afternoon circling around Hubbard Glacier, so in my opinion no need to do the pricey excursion to get closer.  The excursions do feel a tad rushed but worth it.Activities/Entertainment:  This is not what anyone would call a party ship, however the BB King's bar had a fantastic band and we went there dancing almost every night.  Other shows were an awesome illusionist named Kid Ace, a comedian and a dance troupe.  They need to add a musical group, Broadway revue or something like that.  There is also a Lincoln Center area with classical musicians and another area near the casino where dueling pianist/singers played pop music requests.  We went to a couple of demos at the America's Test Kitchen which we enjoyed.  I do think with so much time at sea the ship could have offered a bit more.We had been warned that the ship would be full of elderly people; there were definitely some, but due to the time of year a number of families too so a nice mix.  Not many young adults but we expected that.  Made for a nice low-key vibe.In summary, we were not sure that we were ""cruisers"" but this was a wonderful experience for us all.  Definitely get a balcony room if possible because the sightseeing begins the moment you wake up and look out your window.  And be aware of extra charges for excursions and certain dining experiences.

My family of 4 had a balcony room. The room was pretty spacious and easily fit all of us. I never felt cramped or uncomfortable. There were many good movies we could watch for free in the room TV. Our room was cleaned thoroughly every day by AGUS. He was very friendly and helpful when we had a question for him. Our family ate pretty much every day at the Lido buffet. The food here was delicious, and there were a variety of different foods, including Indian and Asian. The breakfast was very good too. The cooks made tasty omelets, one of my favorite things to eat. I would like to thank cook MOGGIL for his incredible hospitality and friendliness towards me. I was at the buffet counter going to get some pasta, but it had just run out. MOGGIL noticed and ended up leaving the counter to serve me some newly baked pasta a few minutes later. I really appreciated his kindness. In addition, server AEI was very attentive towards my family. Whenever we needed a drink or silverware, she was always prompt in her service. Both she and Moggil always said hello to me when I walked around the Lido buffet. Occasionally my family ate at the Dining Room. Their food was more fancy and had much smaller portions, but nevertheless it was delicious. I am very picky in terms of food, but I always found things I liked onboard the Oosterdam. I liked swimming with my cousins in the hotel pools and hanging out in the whirlpool hot tubs. It was a nice area because the roof above the pool could be opened depending on how hot or cold it was outside. There were a multitude of activities to do onboard the ship, which I appreciated. I participated in bingo, watched a professional quartet, and watched dancers and magicians in the Mainstage. Lastly, the views from aboard the ship were amazing. We saw many glaciers and mountains while sailing to Alaska.

Based on what we heard to be the 'advantages' - how everything is included into one price, pampering on the boat etc,  this cruise was a disappointment. First of all, its billed as an 8 day cruise but when you add up the total hours of time you have off the boat to see the destinations, they total barely over a day so if its places you want to see, this is not the way to do it.  On the boat itself, everything looked a bit old/tired/dated beyond our expectations.  Almost half of all the activities are just 'selling' paid services offered on the boat (e.g. facials etc.).  For the activities that really were free, it was hard to get seating unless you showed up really early to the event.  The best and only thing we really enjoyed was Abby doing the America Test Kitchens.  The whole experience seemed a bit 'cheap' to me. For example, I can understand that alcohol, soft drinks, expression coffees are not free anytime on the boat (can be purchased for a price) but we purchased several meals at their specialty restaurants and you would think at least a soft drink would be included. Not the case. Only water, basic tea and coffee come with the paid for meals!  We also needed to stay in touch during the cruise and purchased the highest level of internet access. What a waste of money. The internet hardly ever worked and the few times it did, it was really slow. We were not trying to stream videos and download anything..... just basic email and web surfing.  Not sure if the level we experienced is 'normal' for cruising but this is not going to make anyone want to come back for more.

They have 5 eateries, 2 have extra charges. The dining room was very classy, and the service was excellent, but too fancy for us. We ate in the Lido restaurant many evenings. Food was ok, but after the fourth day became repetitive. The Pinnacle Grill was superb. Extra cost for this one. They have a pool side eatery called the Dive-In. It was ok(hotdogs, hamburgers) Our room was nice. Balcony, large bathroom (double sink, seperate tub and shower, but did notice a septic smell sometimes), large tv, comfy bed. Entertainment (blues club, bridge, trivia games, cooking presentations, acts) I found mediocre. Have seen better on other cruise ships. Excursions were pricey ($49 per person and as high as $245 per person) after paying quite a bit of money for the cruise we only partook of one excursion in Sitka, Alaska. We paid $89 each for a tour of eagles, bears & a salmon farm. No lunch included. Shopping on board was ok, but not enough.

The salad bar was nice, but the cooked dishes were ill prepared, poorly seasoned and underdone. Chicken noodle soup consisted of clear broth, which tasted ok, with a piece of chicken and barely al dente strands of spaghetti (impossible to eat with a spoon).

The buffet was very crowded, food just average and a table almost impossible to find.  That said, HAL offers 24 hour complimentary room service.

Lauderdale, through the Panama Canal, Central America, down the Mexican Coast to Victoria and Vancouver and on to Seattle.  My husband currently uses a walker and cannot walk at all without it.  First glitch was in embarking. Holland America only had 3 crew members to handle wheelchairs and we had an hour's wait to get on.  No accessible rooms were available, so a suite was our next best option.  Arrived at suite to discover that the bathroom door was of reduced size and a standard sized walker wouldn't fit through the door.  My husband had to ""crab walk"" holding on to the long (double sink) counter to get to the toilet.  The full sized bathtub was useless to us; we've both had knee replacements and aren't agile enough to handle bathtubs.  The shower was very small, only one grab bar & impossible to use without flooding the bathroom floor each time.  Door to balcony was very heavy & threshold was high.  The TV sets are huge and ultra high definition and selection of movies was good.  Unfortunately, while you could blast the volume high enough to rattle windows on all the other channels, it wasn't possible to get enough volume to understand the dialog in the movies.  In the Main Stage showroom, the volume was consistently high enough to damage one's eardrums.  The Main Stage is wonderfully arranged to accommodate wheelchairs and walkers on the main floor.  The rows are far enough apart so that another row would fit between them.  The entertainment was somewhat repetitive and they have discontinued the production numbers.  The only show with more than two performers was the final one which had six.  The ""worker bees"" are, as always on HAL, wonderful, but, for the most part, they are practically running from table to table in the dining room.  Guest Services was especially poor and gave us misinformation on multiple occasions.  We had to go through immigration twice; we supposedly arranged through Guest Services for wheelchair service and they actually tried to deny it to us on one occasion.  My husband could not possibly have walked the long distance involved in getting off and on the ship; it was about half a mile, in one place.  The director of the wheelchair service lied and told us it was only a few steps.  Over all, I believe HAL is subtly (or maybe, not so subtly) trying to discourage disabled passengers, while, for the sake of public relations pretending to welcome them.  They are also the stingiest of the cruise lines when it comes to rewards for past passengers.  Those ""monster"" medals are a joke.  In our case, I think we are cured, and will choose other cruise lines in the future.",Sail Date: April 2019|Cabin Type: Suite|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Mexico|,WashingtonState

Recent attempts to modernize seem forced, and the line continues to miss the basics. Would recommend for those whom prefer to cruise sitting on a balcony all day, for those whom enjoy active vacations stay away. The Gory Detail: We traveled on Holland (HAL) to celebrate a milestone anniversary of my parents. This was my first exposure to HAL, having sailed on several other lines prior. HAL's boarding procedures were among the smoothest and best I've encountered. I was surprised to find that upon boarding at 10:30 am, all staterooms were ready for guests. The staterooms showed their age, with each one having a half tub/shower combination. The rooms however had only 2 drawers located in the bedside tables. This made storage of small items like socks or underwear extremely difficult. The room TV's had only around 5 channels of entertainment, and mainly had on-demand content. We had an oceanview on deck 2 and it was located beneath the venue that was 'BB Kings' at night, and the 'America's Test Kitchen' during the day. We found that the base from the jazz club penetrated everything in our room until the club shut down at midnight every night. We could literally detect what every song being played was because the base and volume was so excessive it penetrated our cabin. In terms of Food, Holland has a wide variety of high quality food. However, it gets exceedingly repetitive after the third day. The leto buffet for example, will have the same offerings at 80% of the stations every day. The first and second days the salad bar is exciting, by the time you're visiting it the fifth or sixth time its old. The main dining room had some gems, but the majority of its food was just acceptable. Its service was terrible with routine dining times exceeding 2 hours for four courses. We also took some time and ate at the pinnacle restaurant, which was very good and worth doing twice! During the sea days on HAL, you will find there is literally nothing to do. On normal lines, the days are jammed packed full of interesting programming from mundane like napkin folding and trivia to deck dance parties. I was surprised to find that HAL's daily program had fewer than 30 total events throughout the day, most of which were sales pitches. For example, multiple days recommended activities included: Go visit the Shore Excursions desk. Things only get worse when we talk about shore visits. We started our trip with a visit to the amazing Half Moon Cay. It was fantastic, but it should be noted every order and transaction on the island was manually recorded by paper order tickets and charged back to your cards later by computer. There is AMPLE room for error and improvement, so watch your invoice closely. After that, we were set to stop in the Cayman Islands at which we were unable to stop at due to waves and that HAL had planned on us tendering via lifeboat. I had the displeasure of using this means to get to shore at our next port in Jamaica. These lifeboats not only had to be 90+ degrees inside, and extremely rocky. Once we reached shore, we found a line of 400+ guests whom were awaiting one of the 2 charted HAL buses to take us to the mouth of the harbor. After waiting for 30 minutes, watching others arrive and cut in lines, and push through, we were among the dozens that returned directly to the ship. Our last stop was Cozumel which was uneventful and nice. Overall, HAL needs to work on its programming its ports of call and its overall culture. With an entire Caribbean of island opportunities why would they chose such awful ports to call on, and via lifeboats. Entertainment needs work too, there should be no hour in the day without activities. And food, the Leto buffet needs to make different meals throughout the cruise. If you have these expectations in mind you will probably find yourself enjoying this cruise, but if this seems like a bridge too far then definitely book elsewhere.",Sail Date: March 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: Family (older kids)|Destination: Caribbean|,"Detroit, Michigan"

Our itinerary took us from Fort Lauderdale to the Bahamas, Jamaica, Cayman Islands, and Cozumel. This was our second trip with Holland America, having previously toured Alaska with the company. We chose HAL both times because it offered the destinations we desired at a reasonable price. While our cruise wasn't perfect, we had an enjoyable time and I would consider sailing with Holland America again. The GoodThe people involved in operating our cruise were all very friendly and professional. From the cruise director to the cabin attendants, everyone treated us with respect and did all they could to make our cruise enjoyable. Our room was quite comfortable and offered a good entertainment system. The TV included many recently-released movies. It reminded me of the entertainment systems found on many airplanes. It was nice to have this source of entertainment for the times when we didn't want to engage with other passengers. We could just retire to our room and enjoy a relaxing movie. Even though we didn't have windows in our cabin, we never felt too cramped or claustrophobic. We greatly enjoyed the team trivia options offered by the ship. These included music trivia, art trivia, and just regular trivia. There were several trivia events each day and we attended as many as we could with great pleasure.The Less GoodThe food on the cruise became a little redundant towards the end of the cruise. While it was tasty, many of the dishes later in the cruise were similar or identical to items served earlier. We also found that it was frequently better to eat in the Lido deck than to visit the main dining room. The main dining room required a lot of rigamarole and took up a lot of time. It was much more efficient to eat at the Lido, especially after a long day of shore excursions. I know that some people desire the fanciness of the main dining room, but it didn't work well with our sensibilities. Holland America tends to cater to an older crowd. While I'm no party animal, it felt like the amenities on board the ship were a bit lackluster when compared with other cruise lines. There isn't really anything exciting to do physically during the days at sea. There is a basketball court on which pickle ball and soccer can also be played, there are some ping pong tables, and there are some swimming areas. Apart from these, your best best for physical activity is to hit the on-board workout center. If you're looking for unique experiences like rock climbing walls, water slides, and similar activities, this is not the cruise line for you.This is a minor complaint, but our cruise took place during the NFL playoffs. We could not watch several games and were limited to the few games that could be seen on ESPN. I would imagine that there would be similar difficulties during the playoffs of other major sports. I don't know if other cruise lines offer a greater access to professional sports, but if this is something of great importance to you, it may be worth investigating other cruise options. My biggest complaint with the cruise was their planning for food options on the Cozumel day. Our ship left port at 11:00 PM, and by the time we got back on board, there were not a lot of options for food available. The Lido deck offered a ""late night snack,"" but many people crowded the space and made for long lines. We ended up eating bowls of pasta consisting of whatever toppings were left over by the time we cleared the line. It would have been nice for the ship to anticipate these crowds and schedule more food options for the evening of such a late departure.A Final NoteOne of my bigger regrets is not attending the captain's presentation on the main stage. My family members went to this presentation and they said that it was the best part of the cruise. If you're interested in the inner workings of the ship, consider attending this event. There is even a question and answer session with the captain where you can obtain direct responses to your questions.If you're looking for excitement and youth, this is not the cruise line for you. If you want a more elegant and low key experience, Holland America is right up your alley. You can't beat the price, and will surely have an enjoyable experience.",Sail Date: January 2019|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: Family (multi-generational)|Destination: Caribbean|,"Chicago, Illinois"

The ship was new and large. Main hub of the ship is a 3 level atrium. The atrium is surrounded by bars, cafes, restaurants and shops with some seating which was not quite enough- lots of passengers standing or sitting on the stairs. Deck 7 is the main thoroughfare level of the ship stretching from the Princess theatre at the front to the Vista Gaming Lounge at the back. On the way you will pass shops, bars, speciality restaurants and another small theatre called Princess Live. The main theatre is too small for the number of passengers and size of the ship, only 1 level but accessed from 2 floors. You need to get there early to get a seat and take a drink with you, as bar service is non-existent. Shows were typical cruise fare. The cabin still presented as new, clean, spacious enough with a big walk-in robe with a large amount of coat hangers! Bathroom with toilet and shower were off the walk-in robe. The 'balcony' was small and never used. Cabin air-conditioning was efficient and there was a large screen tv with new on demand content and a selection of live tv channels which do not work while in port. We did anytime dining in the main dining rooms and never waited long for a table at breakfast, lunch or dinner. Breakfast service could be slow. The quality of the food was good but the variety of dishes needs to extended. The buffet was a bit of a scrum with some effort needed to find a table. Food was ok but needs to be varied a bit more as over our 8 day cruise it seemed like the same old choices. It was generally agreed by regular Princess cruisers that staff service and Princess Cruises standards was slipping and I did not find some of the staff that friendly. We liked the trivia and the comedian Sam McCool. The price of cocktails and spirits is excessive. We were not pestered by photographers or attempts to sell drinks or dining packages. Internet service on the ship is very patchy and due to her size the Majestic  Princess is not bothered too much by bad weather. The Crown Grill speciality restaurant was fine the Harmony Chinese restaurant can be given a miss- not your usual dishes.",Sail Date: February 2020|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Australia|,

Having not cruised since turning 50, I wasn't sure what to expect and had some concerns about the size of this ship. I'm not good with crowds and my previous cruise left me feeling a bit ho-hum about the food. So, to summarize our experience - starting with embarkation - this went without a hitch and we were on the ship in no time at all. The Majestic is only 3 years old and was stunning. Our stateroom was comfortable - definitely no complaints about the very comfortable bed, plenty of storage space, both hanging ( lots of hangers too) and under bed. I wasn't sure about power outlets - our stateroom had 1 aussie, 2 asian(2 round pins), 2 US (3 rectagular holes) and 2 USB charging ports. The ship is spacious, with loads of open areas, some busy/noisy such as the three level atrium, the place to be if you like to be 'where it's all happening' as there was always plenty going on. If you like music, Crooners Bar, Princess live studio for trivia quizzes, bingo, demonstrations, lectures. Our favourite spot was the Wake Bar at the back of the ship. But there is also the pool deck with the big screen playing movies and a variety of other things throughout the day and night ( we were impressed by picture and sound quality). At the front upper levels is an adults only sanctuary, with a pool, bar in one part then a area with private quiet areas, and card playing tables. A good selection of board games, cards, majhong tiles, etc available in the library. I tought the gym was really impressive too. Plenty of treadills, cross trainers, exercise bikes, rowing machines, pin weight machines, free weights, yoga mats, etc - there even some classes (educational and group fitness). Only down side was the short walking track that required going through 2 gates in and out of the basketball courts. Othere than that table tennis, golf nets, golf putting. Prior to leaving i had some concerns about the availability/potential cost of drinking water - the tap water is potable and tastes OK, there are also drink stations around with filtered water and ice, waiters more than happy to bring water. Alcohol prices - beer AUD $8.75 per stubbie, you could get a bucket of 5 for the price of 4 in the Wake Bar. Wine - limited choice and overpriced at $11-14 per glass or buy a bottle for ~$42 which you could leave at the bar/restaurant for later consumption. I took 8 bottles on board that I purchased from a liquor store at Circular Quay and paid $15 corkage on 6 of them - better wine and significantly cheaper, and I just carried a bottle with me to where we were eating or drinking. The entertainment offered in the Princess Theatre was excellent, Fiera a must. The English Pub night hilarious - the list is endless. Then there's the food. I was amazed at the quality and choices offered. I'm not a fan of buffets, but it was so good we kept going back! The anytime dining worked well too. We were a group of 6, so we generally had to wait (with a buzzer in hand) no more than 30 mins. Pizza was OK but the calzone in Alfredo's excellent. Good steak at Crown Grill. Then embarkation, wow. We opted for express walk off taking our own luggage and it took around 11 mins til were off the ship!! Overall, a great experience and one we would likely repeat, and repeat on Princess.

All our favourite dancing venues found on the smaller Princess ships have disappeared including the Wheelhouse Bar, Explorers lounge, Club Fusion and Shywalkers Lounge. These have been replaced by more cabins and paying restaurants. The only dance floor is in the piazza/atrium. At nite time toddlers, young kids, bogans, drunks, ballroom dancers and line dancers tried to use at the same time. Absolute chaos. We complained to staff about safety issues of kids on dance floor and idiots with drink glasses and beer bottles but no action taken. There were no dress standards enforced on the dance floor at nite time with people in shorts and thongs walking around dance floor. The marketplace buffet was overcrowded on sea days. The four lane layout simply doesn’t work. The food was bland and boring. Lots of mince, meatball and potato dishes. No authentic Italian, Thai, Mexican, Thai dishes etc. Three hundred kg of cherries disappeared in 10 minutes flat taken by rude greedy people. Staff in buffet very stressed over rude behaviour of a certain class of people. It seems to us that the beautiful love boat has been overcommercialised.

Bloody terrible indeed but then I couldnt get the package deal because the bloke doing that was doing something else and they told me to come back the next day...Nar, I did that but was told you have to get it the first day!!!! Then they run out of most Australian type beers and sold the scraps from the cellars. Was unbelievable to tell the truth and the worst Princess cruise however we decided to give them one more chance before we changed cruise lines and the line up was still on but that was only for 2 hours but then they put the priority folf in a air con room and waited only for 2 more hours.

On the first trip we went to the what they call famous Chinese restaurant and it was quite nice however on the next cruise one year later it was shithouse.

Boarding was ok, he had trouble getting his card.  We had a Suite right at the front, wonderful picture window and it was enormous.  Unfortunately it was cold and windy as we sailed away so no sail away party.  We were Club Class in the Concerto dining room.  Staff immediately remembered your name and food and service were 5 star.  We booked all our excursions before leaving and apart from one in Brisbane, which we had to book last minute because original one was cancelled, they were all brilliant.  We met some great people, including a couple who lived in the same town!The cabin steward was outstanding and the Suite was always spotless.We ate breakfast in the restaurant every morning, and dinner there every night.  We had the occasional lunch at the buffet, but would take it outside to eat.

In many respects the cruise was up to Princess' usual standards but in some respects exceeded them and in some respects were worse. On the positive side, the Buffet (Market Place) had improved enormously from our last cruise. The choice was much greater and was well prepared/presented. They even re-introduced their cold seafood buffet on one occasion and baked a number of huge cakes on the penultimate day of each cruise. The number of passengers on board meant that sometimes it was difficult to get a table and there were often lines for sections of the food but this did not detract from the overall improvement. The shows were on the whole quite good especially the musicians and singers but regrettably the comedians were only one notch above their American counterparts! The drinks packages were expensive (£55 per day approx) but this had the distinct advantage to us that by buying the drinks individually we saved over £600 over the two cruises! The other bonus was that they had Newcastle Brown Ale on draft (although £6 per pint approx)! As usual the excursions were expensive but as it was a long way to go and it is unlikely that we will be in that area again, we booked them and to be fair they were all good, especially the Debark at the end of the Cruise around Sydney which was really excellent although we found that we did not have enough time at Bondi Beach. Other highlights were the Rhododendrons in Dunedin were spectacular, the Koala Sanctuary in Brisbane was well worth a visit and the trip on the Aquaduck in Airlie Beach was fun. One thing to be aware of is that the last ""port"" on the Australia Leg was Willis Island which is a weather station. It is simply a cruise around for 30/40 minutes to watch the weather balloon being let off. Surely there could have been another port we could have called in at? This meant that  the last 3 days of the cruise were all sea days back to Sydney from Port Douglas. Most of the ports had shuttles into town some of which had to be paid for. Brisbane especially where we were docked a long way out of the City and the shuttle cost A$25.The weather across the Tasman Sea (both ways) was not good and the cruising around Fjordland was to a certain extent hampered by low cloud and rain but the sights were magnificent. The weather improved as we went north up the South and North Islands and then again as we went up the coast of Australia until it reached a humid 93 degrees F in Cairns. If we were to go again I think we would book a cruise a couple of weeks later so that there may be better weather and the flowers/trees would be in fuller bloom.Now for the negatives. Embarkation and disembarkation were fine but the transit arrangements is Sydney were abysmal. We were told in the transit presentation that there would be a transit lounge in the terminal where we could sit, from when we had to leave the ship (0930) until we could re-board (approx 1100). No such lounge was provided, indeed we were told there was not one in the terminal, so we had to stand in the heat of the baggage area for the duration. It was only at the very end that a few chairs were provided for the elderly who could not stand (of which there were a number). We had booked a Mini-Suite after some debate about whether it was worthwhile over a Balcony Stateroom. Quite frankly it was not. All the facilities were there and it was kept spotless by our stateroom steward but, compared with mini-suites on other ships, it was so small. My wife and I (who are about standard size for our age) could not pass each other at the end of the bed or in the passage/hanging space by the bathroom, one had to get out of the way to let the other pass. The balcony had two reclining chairs and a table but was so small that the only sitting position was upright and the legroom was minimal. We understand that the next two Princess ships are the same deign so will probably suffer from the same problems. The food in the dining room was at best tepid and was in small portions. We did ask for the food to be warmed up which happened for a couple of evenings but then went back to being lukewarm. On occasions my wife was unable to cut into her baked potato. Service was slow, one evening it took 2 hours 20 minutes to have our dinner. Regrettably the on-deck Pizza place had been replaced by a Noodle Bar but there was a Pizza Restaurant in the Piatzza to replace it. It seemed a long way to go for a Pizza so we did not use it.We are glad that we did this cruise but wish that it had been on one of the older Princess Ships a couple of weeks later.",Sail Date: November 2019|Cabin Type: Suite|Type of Trip: |Destination: Australia|,"London, United Kingdom"

In-cabin TV services were good as was the breakfast to your cabin.  Our room was always spotless and our steward did a great job looking after us.  My only complaint with the cabin is that the AC was not very consistent and the room was either too hot or too cold for my comfort - it became a problem at night and detracted from the quality of my sleep.Shows onboard were very, very good but you do need to get to the theatre a bit early to be sure of getting a seat.Shopping was okay but some shops left a lot to be desired.  Jewellery was ordinary and overpriced and art auctions were predominantly giclees or other types of reproductions and didn't impress us too much.  We choose traditional dining with a set time and table and were thrilled with the service we received.  It was great and so was the food.  Portions were modest but they are happy to provide more if you ask for it.  The buffet could get very busy and finding a table was difficult on occasion.  We didn't use the specialty dining as they offered very few vegetarian option that appealed to us.Soda package seemed a bit expensive to us but was convenient.  Would also have liked to known the price of that package before boarding and don't understand why  couldn't find out the price.  Coffee card was good value and the coffee was nice.Shore excursions were expensive but we chose to use them for the peace of mind knowing the ship would wait for us if late - and we were 45 minutes late back to the dock from one excursion - but the ship was there and we had no problem getting back on board.We had bad experiences at both the hamburger stand and noodle bar where we found the staff to be rude and less than competent.  This was a real shame as the rest of the crew were, without exception, friendly, polite and helpful.Unfortunately the ship was late getting back to Sydney due to weather conditions in the Tasman Sea which slowed our passage.  This didn't prove to be a problem for us as we had pleasant of time to get the the airport, but many other passengers missed flights or other transport connections.All in all we enjoyed our cruise very much.  The demographic on our Princess cruise was largely older guests and we encountered no unpleasantness from loutish or intoxicated passengers.

Unfortunately as the ships get bigger their attention to detail and customer service seems to get stretched to the limits and kind of gets lost. Maybe the ships are just getting too big and are starting to loose the plot a bit. Don't get me wrong cruiser's, Princess have a great product no doubt about it but feel they do not listen to the complaints or feedback given to them. Our cruise of 14 days was good but felt some things needed tweaking: The camera section is way, way to big for what it offers as it takes up too much real estate on board which could be used for better purposes. The Pizza restaurant is just ok but the Pizzas are not that great due to poor toppings/selections. However the base is good. If your going to do a good Pizza, please ,please do it RIGHT! The food upstairs in what I call the 'food-o-rama buffet needs to be looked at. Not too bad but if I see roast chicken again I'm going to scream. Have noticed the quality of the food is a bit hit and miss at times. The place I recommend is the Grill where you will get the best steaks anywhere and the staff are 6******. Speaking of staff around the ship, they looked at times exhausted. The standout for us was our cabin attendant JUN. If I could give him 7******* I would.The restaurants are just ok and the portions are small, however don't be afraid to ask for more of what you like as there is no charge (not sure if this applies to the Grill). The ship is relatively new, Gargantuan in size and easy to get lost for the first few days. But hey, that's all part of the journey. I recommend Princess as have tried the rest (Cunard, P&O, Holland, Norwegian, Carnival etc, and found this to be the best.

It cam as a shock.  Our first impression was one of dissapointment.  We were hearded into a lower deck and lined up to get a cruise card and have and on-board credit account processed.  From there we were told to go find our suite,, no sign of help by an escort.  After going up 7 decks and walking a third the length of the sip we found it.  The steward was there to greet us and a lovely person she was, but really provided no help settling in.  She did tell me the mini-bar was provided for ONE fill only, after that it was $7 for whisky, same for other spirits and beers.  Mixwes were $3.something each and water much the same.  Well this was not the impression when booking but as it turned out it was how just about everything on the cruise moved along, one paid for espresso coffee, tea etc at most outlets on borad, dinks at the bar we expensive as were soft drinks and beer.  In the restaurants wine was marked up between about 80% for expensive wines and about 400% for lesser wines.  One favourite of mine was $42 aboard while I buy it on line at home for around $11-12.  At almost every turn money was squeezed from you.  Although we did not take tours ashore they were expensive so we just walked and had our own fun.  Entertainment abourd was free and there were about 5 or 6 things every hour one could go to.  The only thing we went to was two winetastings, the first $36 for a thimble full of each of six wines for the first tasting and #13 for the second with five wines, two of which I found undrinkable one being 'off' in my opinion.  The other entertainment option was a casino which we did not frequent and it is doubtless another way the company has to fleece you.The food was good overall.  We ate in a section of one dining room separated for suite passengers for dinner each night, and had a special suite only guests breakfast room.  Lunch was another thing.  There were two small street stall type places with hamburgers and one with asian noodles, both OK.  The HUGE buffet available was OK but crowded and competative eating - ugh!  The service in the restaurants was excellent and attentive.  The ship had three specialty restaurants with a cover charge from $39 to $29.  We tried one and it was no better than the one that had no charge.Our cabin was large with a big balcony and two rooms, a lounge and bedroom.  Was quite nice but strangely had no dining table but did have two desks - wonder why?Overall we did not like such a large ship, one spends so much time moving from your cabin to the venue you are heading to.  It was also unfriendly, passengers liked to stick to them selves.  At dinner we always asked for a share table and only once did anyone want to share with us.

Then again 4am the same thing. This happened night after night. M324 do not accept this cabin. Of course we complained but nothing changed. The cruise is catered in every way for the China Chinese market, and they all seemed happy but cruisers form elsewhere that we met including Chinese cruisers from Singapore and HongKong who were all so unhappy with the cruise.  Buffet area - wow get ready to fight, for whatever reason people are stockpiling the food on their plates in the buffet even though the food never stops and the serving dishes are constantly replenished, its total madness.  People pushing in front of me holding plates above my head, spitting into cups, spitting on plates and  in napkins.  What disgusted me was the behaviour of the crew who simply let it happen. There was no control over hand washing and very few people washed their hands and the crew member did nothing to encourage it.   Breakfast was a stamped.  Dirty tables everywhere, crew walking around with jugs of coffee instead of cleaning tables!  So there was nowhere to sit, It wasn't as if we had a choice on when to eat as we were governed by the excursions times.  Majestic is a beautiful ship but on this cruise it mattered not. This ship is lawless, I didn't feel safe or comfortable and I was truly glad when it was over. This is a cruise for the China Chinese market thats it.  If you don't fall into this category you will hate this cruise.  They have stripped all the luxury of normal cruising and made it budget and it showed.  Entertainment is for the Chinese, Karaoke 98% Chinese songs, most of the fun things are in Chinese.  Well there are at least 3000 Chinese (crew said 4000) on the ship and around 1000 others (Brits, Aussies, Singaporean, HongKong).  It felt very overcrowd during the day, but the Chinese seem to retire early so evenings were pretty quiet around the ship.  It Seemed understaffed to be honest.  Food everywhere was poor.  Mostly Chinese food and not great Chinese food, tried the speciality restaurants and they were no better.  The only saving grace was the Chef Darren Maclean who had his own menu in the french bistro Le Mer which was excellent so we ate his 3 course and nine course 2 nights running.  Spitting is the one talked about topic that the ""others"" complained about, the other subject was overcrowding, there seemed to be a lot of people in each cabin, we met people who said one night their neighbours had 10 people on their balcony!! Surely there is a weight limit on a balcony for safety reasons.  Other cruisers said they had seen extra beds in the area next to the bathroom and cabins for 4 max had 6 instead?  Wow.  Ive never seen so many children on a ship before, I thought there were strict quotas for children.    The adults only area ha ha ha your joking right, - full of kids.  Also forget all the nonsense emailed to you pre-cruise from Princess as it doesn't happen on this cruise.  Voice of the ocean - nope, big theatre nightly shows - nope (only 2 the whole week).

We have been quite pleasantly surprised at the quality of the cruise The staff is attentive and thorough, the staff is courteous and helpful, and the staff is very well trained. The food in the dining room is average for a cruise, and the food in the buffet is outstanding. We are fortunate to be in a suite, and breakfast in the Crown Grill is worth the extra money.We are on an Asian tour from Shanghai to Sydney. The ship staff have done an excellent job with preparation for tours, and we have never been delayed more than expected.

The lack of control of the 1000 children on board was beyond belief.  Kids still running around dance floors in bars at 10PM.  I was sitting in a spa in Hollwood area and a man not once but twice hoiked and spat flem all over the wooden slatted step you had to stand on when exiting the spa.  We are big users of spa and pools and never went back near them for rest of trip.  People going into main dining room on normal nights and formal nights in shorts, singlets and flip flops.  Jeans and tshirts.  Princess really let themselves down on this cruise.  The marketplace buffet was like a zoo at meal times.  We ended up on level 5 in the coffee shop having breakfast and lunch.  The staff on this ship did a wonderful job under the dreadful conditions and behaviour of some passengers.  The ship is lovely and our cabin steward Rommies on Emerald deck made our trip.  Princess is lucky to have him.  Be very careful booking this ship.  The Casino doors were left open and smoked billowed into atrium area and you could smell it all through the atrium.  We have spent over 365 days sailing with Princess and this is the first time we have ever encountered such a drop in standards and food.

It feels closed in in the public areas.  Low ceilings and small halls etc just gave me a closed in feeling. There was nothing really grand about the dining room: it was perfectly nice just nothing special. I had read alot about the beautiful atrium/piazza, again, nice but nothing really special. The rooms were also nice enough, although I have been in nicer rooms on other cruise lines. I wish there had been a lounge chair or small couch so that you didn't have to sit on the bed all the time. (Speaking of that: our cabin steward made our bed before we checked out even though we told him we would be back--that grossed me out, knowing he had likely done the same thing before we checked in so we might be sitting on someone else's ""germs"")I really likely that there we laundry facilities onboard. We had taken a land tour prior to our cruise and it was nice to be able to do laundry without having to pay the ship's laundry rates.The food on this ship is, at best, uninspired. The buffet is similar to a low priced family buffet (Golden Corral for those in the US). The food is basically the same every day: there is really nothing ""wrong"" with it, it is just boring and not particularly flavorful.  Getting a piece of bread toasted is a challenge, you have to track down a toaster, then an employee and then get them to toast it. It would be better if the toasters were available for anyone to use.  We only ate at the buffet for breakfast after the first day because of the ""blah-ness"" of the food. Because of New Zealand's strict vegetation restrictions the fruit was cut up so you couldn't take it ashore. I didn't mind the apples, etc but peeling the bananas and cutting them in half was weird. We also struggled to get a refill on our beverages. Finding a seat was a bit of a challenge as well.We ate at the pizza restaurant several days, and we ate at the noodle bar several days for lunch. Both were tasty and fairly easy to get beverage refills. The burger bar was also pretty good.The main dining room was also okay: some of the food was really good, some just ""okay"".The desserts were absolutely nothing to write home about. You expect cruise desserts to be special but they just weren't. Again, getting a refill on our beverage was almost no-existent. It shows that the service wasn't what you would expect.The casino was small and the game payouts were not very ""generous"" I played very little.The shows were fine: I enjoyed them. My husband wasn't as impressed. As indicated in other reviews the theater just isn't big enough for the number of people onboard. The best night was the day that had 3 shows.Embarkation was great: very smooth and quick-we were in our rooms in less than a half hour. The rooms were ready when we got on so there was no lugging around your carry on bag while you ate lunch or had a drink. Very little pressure to buy beverage packages or upgrade to specialty dining. That was nice.We loved all of the ports of call: however, there were two things that weren't so good. There was a change in itinerary that resulted in less than normal time in two of the ports. Tauranga was very odd because we got in at 4:30 am. No shore excursions started that early(obviously) and most of them were fairly long so they ended up feeling rushed in order to get back to the ship on time. (We used a secondary provider instead of the ship's offerings.) Several of the ship's tours came back late so the ship had to leave late.The tours in Akaroa were also late getting back resulting in very long lines to get a tender and very few people got back to the ship at the recommended ""on board"" time. I think we were about 2 hours or better late leaving that port.  It appears that Princess has some issues either with their own timing or that of their vendors to get back in a timely fashion. (one of the Princess tour buses ran out of gas and one had their keys stolen by a biker--made me glad that I was on an aftermarket tour)We were in Cabin D227. This is a great cabin for the price: We had a big balcony, bigger than the mini suite below us and most of the other balcony rooms. It had a very small bathroom but it worked fine.The pillows were very comfortable but I felt the bed was a little soft. My husband thought the bed was good.The closet was roomy and there was plenty of room to store suitcases in the closet or under then bed.",Sail Date: February 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Australia|,"Moline, Illinois"

Excellent business class standard,"MAJESTIC PRINCESS MARCH 26-APRIL 14, 2019 SYDNEY TO HONGKONGI am an Elite cruiser, and this is my 13th voyage on Princess, 1st time on Majestic Princess.Majestic Princess was launched in 2017, the largest ship in the Princess feet.  Overall in solid business class condition, the food and entertainment consistent and of a very good standard. Firm and favorable recommendation to anyone wanting a good quality, big ship cruise experience. My critique, is based on my many cruises and any criticism is aimed only at seeking improvementEmbarkationShip boarded at Sydney. Large queue on arrival, but with my wife’s left knee requiring management, she was wheel chaired aboard, prompt, quick and efficient service. The ship in generalThe Majestic Princess is a large ship, 143,000 tons. Some people aboard found the size of the ship a little overwhelming and they thought a smaller ship would be more to their liking. We can understand that but we like the larger ships with more people and facilities and choices on board. Although there were approximately 3500 passengers on board, it did not feel crowded. So many choices, which are the great delight of cruising, one does as little or as much to do as you like. Some passengers take that for granted, mumbles here and there, but we value the great choices available! I often strolled through the ship at 6.30am in the morning, hardly a person to be seen!Used the Gym fitness machines each day, excellent facility, but the background music is too loud. There is no need for such sound, if you want to listen to music or television etc., a range of personal devices are available. Silence is Golden, great views from the Gym, why a heavy soundtrack.Pools and spa facilities as you expect, available, and nice, off peak the time to go, pools can be cluttered during the day. The Adults only Hollywood Conservatory is an excellent new addition, with great views and seating options, and being a covered pool, no weather problems. Princess cruises add a USD 12.50 a day per person amount to your bill and that covers your tipping for the total cruise. This is done so that people employed on the ship who are not in direct contact with the ship can also receive something. If you don’t like this idea you can arrange with the Pursers office to have the amount reduced if you wish, and envelopes for tips are available. Library facilities were disappointing, combined with the Computer room, and we personally missed the huge observation lounge facility on earlier class ships(Sky walker), and the limited walk around the ship facility for the walkers, it’s there but this time 6.5 times area around equals 1 mile and the area is contained. The other bars and public seating areas of the Majestic Princess were excellent, roomy and stylish. Spot entertainment e.g. pianist, vocalist, violin trio etc. were visible and pleasant. Listening to these spot artists, can make a cruise very pleasant.The shopping available on the ship is the biggest at sea 1000 sq. feet, mostly high end. Watch and clothing sales abounded, and the 3 hour clearance scrambles, always available. Another variety style shop would be useful, not really convinced, about diamond and jeweler shops, obviously enough people are buying product to keep open. Princess has done away with the on ship news sheets for USA, Britain, and Aussie etc.  This is short sighted, many commenting on the lack of daily international news. Yes it might be available on the web, but the web at sea is costly, and soaks up time, hopefully these sorts of publications will return, when the world realizes technology is just another tool, and many people like something to hold and reflect on in their own time.Floor shows in the evening, and specifically the Princess Theatre Dance Company and singers were excellent. They did 4 presentations, equal to Broadway show standard, and the standard of these productions continue to improve and creativity very much in vogue. Excellent recording stars on each night, standard excellent.  Overall the formal and stage entertainment was of good quality, all part of your travel packageSolid range of late release movies shown on upper deck, available in room, or at advertised locations. Good work here Princess, my wife watched more than a few while reclining in the cabin. The more movies the better, it’s an ageless form of entertainment, and Princess Cruise deserves a bow for their up to date movie selection A number of presentations or lectures on this cruise, none of which jumped out as greatExcellent range of cooking demonstrations, wine tastings, excellent range of choices every day, including the usual bingo, table tennis, bridge games. Art pictures shows were very visual.Soft freeze cone ice-cream available at no cost throughout the day, a nice treat, but real ice-cream limited on the voyage The weather conditions throughout were very good and no rough days at all, so the luck ran our way. However motion sickness can be an issue, and any cruise if you are susceptible, prepare in advance. DiningTraditional 1st or second sitting evening dining room sitting versus anytime dining are great options. We prefer anytime dining, and there were 2 choices plus the 24 hour buffet, plus the 24 hour International Café, and the open deck grill and Pizza bar options, also the  Asian Noodle bar, produced  good soups.We mixed breakfast venues. Dining formal on some days, buffet the next, sometimes dined for lunch in the traditional dining room (not available in the evening for anytime diners) and then at night, in one of the 2 anytime restaurants. Menu in each is the same as traditional dining restaurant, but we liked the change of waiters, décor and loved being able to eat anytime in the evening between 5.30pm and 10pm.  If you had not booked, there was sometimes a small wait, but no great problem. A number of specialist restaurants are available.  The Crown Grill (steak) restaurant, a French Restaurant Le Mer and the Cantonese Harmony restaurant all with A$ surcharge of $29-35 per person. The real issue is a specialist restaurant at $60 per couple good vale. In my view once only, plenty of choice for free elsewhere.The 24 Hour International Café was a real bonus. Great informal, pick your choice, from a salad to a cake, great alternative to the full meal service which abounds on the ship.  The buffet at Market Place was good value, everything seemed fresh, lots of choice and we thought the food tasted fine.  Open most hours was great. Service was good, and their breakfast buffet top class. You read some sharp comments about the cruise buffets; I think they offer excellent value, wide choice and sound presentation. You must be a very fussy eater, if you complain about sub-standard Princess cruise buffets.A nice touch each afternoon was the English afternoon tea served by waiters in white gloves 3.30-4.30pm, in one of the main dining rooms. Room ServiceAvailable 24 hours at no charge, limited menu but pleasant, nice to be relaxing in your room, and some refreshment arriving.Our cabinWe had an interior Cabin, on the 12th floor. Pleasant. We made the decision not to have a balcony cabin, on cost differential and because many sea days, it was the right decision for us.The design of the cabin made good use of large mirrors to enhance the feeling of light and maximize space. The open space wardrobes without doors provided plenty of hanging and excellent storage space for our requirements. .Our main cases fitted side by side quite comfortably. Bedside lights have dimmer switches. Soaps and towels were changed twice a day. Bathroom shower was pressure excellent. Air conditioning was excellent. There is a safe in every room and our cabin had a fridge. Outside your door on the side is a paper holder with your cabin number on it so that the any newsletters or other information can be left for you. The Television was a good size.  No noise transference issues on this trip, you need luck with who are your neighbors’, this time quiet.If you wish to drink bottled wines in your cabin Princess seem to have no problems with you purchasing wines or champagne and bringing them on board at embarkation (Small print says 2 bottles). You can take these wines into the dining room but you will be charged an USD15.00 corkage fee if you take them into the dining roomsPORTS OF CALLBig ships often mean you are located long distances from City. Ships are coy re detail on Port facilities, and access to City location. They want you to utilize on each occasion the formal ship tours, which are well organized, but costly. Independent travelers are tolerated, but they limit information as a means of keeping the formal tour numbers up. The internet is surprisingly limited re detailed information on Ports of Call (often very dated too), and guide books like Lonely Plant, virtually ignore it. 	Brisbane is a poor port, industrial, and 25 K from City. Bus shuttle $25 each way. New Terminal required.	Darwin is the opposite, lovely port, great walkways, easy access to City.	Singapore, great Port, and many excursions.	Phu My, Vietnam: Gateway to Ho Chi Min City (Saigon) one and a half hours each way. Ships excursions the way to go here   A free shuttle with a 40 minute ride to   local Ba Ria township was the alternative, a nice respite from the sea days	Kaohsiung Taiwan: 2nd largest city, 3 million people. Excursions or free shuttle to a Large City Store for shopping was available	Hong Kong. Disembark here. We spent 3 nights at the Hotel Vic, North Point, lovely hotel, and well up to our expectations.DisembarkationGetting off the ship at Hong Kong was easier than expected. We made the decision to be in first group off, a choice we have due to our past record with Princess and the long wait for Taxi-Princess warned up to 4 hours wait - did not eventuate. Hong Kong has a poor reputation for taxi service from the Port, surprising for one of the great Tourist destinations; they need to address such issues",Sail Date: March 2019|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Asia|,"Auckland, New Zealand"

After doing three cruises with this cruise line we had raved about how good Princess was and unfortunately was very disappointed, we had a Mini-suite which is basically a Balcony cabin with an extra fold out bed, it was good enough for us. the food, however was very boring and it didn't seem to matter if we ate in the buffet or the dining restaurants, it was the same bland food, - leaving us little choice but to pay extra and eat in the specialty restaurants which seem to have increased on this ship from previous ships we have sailed on. There also appeared to be a distinct lack of wait staff in most of the coffee and bar areas, and we had to go and order/collect drinks ourselves on many occasions.the main ""Atrium"" area may be a new concept by Princess however due to the proliferation of specialty restaurants and Shops/Photo shop etc, there was a huge lack of seating areas to watch or participate in whatever was happening down on deck 5 (the atrium floor) the viewing from decks seven and six in the Atrium was further decreased by very large banners hung down from above deck 7 to the bottom of deck 6 all around the Atrium thereby obstructing a large part of the available viewing. On a good note was that of the quality of the shows in the Theater - absolutely world class! top marks to the singers, dancers and visiting performers, but why was the Vista lounge ( apart from Bingo, Art Auctions and the odd quiz show) mainly empty? Finally, an appeal to Princess regarding their Disembarkation policies at ports visited, given our cruise had a very large demographic of aged and infirm cruisers who had every right to get off the ship in each port, it caused long queues and long waiting times to get off, surely arrangements could have been made to accommodate these passengers from a different deck (lower deck perhaps) which would have been a benefit to all passengers.",Sail Date: March 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Family (multi-generational)|Destination: Australia|,"Perth, Australia"

Everything seemed new, bright and cheery.  My cabin was the perfect size, and the bed an accommodations were really nice. The bathroom wasn't big, but just fine.  Storage wasn't an issue at all either.  The balcony was the perfect size as well for sitting and watching the waves go by.I found the ship really easy to navigate, and the public spaces were open and not crowded.  I met some other new to cruise people, and we got to talking how it was exceeding our expectations for being open and airy.  The food overall was good, but not 5 star (and that wasn't expected).  A favorite hang out was the Wake View bar.  Not many people there, great service and a chill environment.  The inside bars were nice during the evening though, and enjoyed a drink at all of them.  The buffet was standard, with the food being OK but nothing special to speak of.  I did get to enjoy some of the premium restaurants.  La Mer was excellent, as was Harmony.  I was not impressed with Crown Grill though, of which I thought it would be my favorite.  They seared the steak tartare... which I thought the point of tartare was raw.  It was odd, and ruined the texture.  The rest of the meal was OK, but not exceptional.  I would skip this next time, and go back to Harmony for their duck.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with my trip, and left the ship wanting to do this again.

A cruise is a lovely way to visit and experience a new place.  Princess is our favorite cruise line for many reasons and always our first choice.  They offer many options for cruising to Australia and New Zealand, including land tours.  Since a land tour was out of our budget, we opted for the 12 night New Zealand from Sydney; and were very happy with our experience, feeling we had a great introduction. The next big decision was which Princess ship to choose.  Do we want the small ship experience or the large ship experience?  This time we opted for the beautiful, new, large Majestic Princess. The ship and crew did not disappoint!  The ship is incredible with all the current amenities possible. The staff are top notch as well. We have sailed many times and can easily say the embarking and disembarking at the Port of Sydney was the best ever. When onboard we appreciate our clean, comfortable, well kept cabin. We enjoy the fitness options and the spa.  Food is a priority and there are many delicious options onboard this ship, including room service, which we made use of for some delicious lunches served in our mini suite.  We enjoyed the onboard entertainment, that we chose to go to but that was minimal. There were many shore excursions offered through the ship and we used this as research for what we wanted to see and do at each port visited, booking activities in Akaora and Dunedin. Trip Advisor proved to have the best shore excursion options and we booked activities in Auckland, Tauranga, and Wellington. All in all this was a truly wonderful vacation.

We also took advantage of the Wine Makers Private dinner hosted by the Maitre d Hotel and Executive Chef in a beautiful crystal decorated dining room. Food and wine were fantastic as was the service. The only dining downside was the specialty restaurant Le Mar that was touted as a French inspired dining experience. The food was not prepared to our liking. The escargot was terrible and the service not up to par. I found the escargot served in the dining room was fantastic. Skip this restaurant.

We booked on the Majestic Princess when the boat was brand new so there was not many reviews to go off of.  The boat was also built for the Asian market according to all we had read.  That did concern me a little and like I said we couldn't find much about the boat.  I will say after we arrived the boat is amazing!  our room was over the top.  We had a suite right across the hall from the concierge lounge.  It was great to be able to go in there and grab snacks and some juices when ever we wanted.  The restaurants on board are great.  We did eat at the Crown Grill a number of times as well as La Mer and the normal restaurant.  The one high light I think during the day was the pizzeria.  If you sit at the bar it is unreal to watch the cooks make the pizzas.  we ate there probably 3-4 times for lunch and no one ever sat at the bar.  We always asked and loved the show.  After 12 days of being on the ship I didn't want to get off.  I could have stayed on.  I have been on about 16 cruises and I will say there have been times on different boats I was ready to leave but no this one.  If I had one negative to say about the boat or one thing I would change I would say the shopping on board was higher end.  I think if they brought that down to something a little more middle of the road they would have seen more people enjoying that.  I highly recommend this boat and this cruise line.

One tour in each port is included with paid tours available.

We have previously done many cruises with Regent, Azamara, Oceania and Seabourn, all of which we have enjoyed. This is the first with Viking but were very impressed indeed - the itinerary, ship, food, staff and value for money were all excellent and we'll be looking to sail with them again. The ship, Viking Sun, was only around two years old and it showed in every way with a very thoughtful and efficient layout which showed the design reflects what cruise passengers want. The ageing Renaissance class ships of Regent etc couldn't hope to compete with this particularly when you look at the cost of Regent cruises these days which definitely do not represent value for money. Even when you add in all the included shore trips, which they seem to have cut back costs on, I feel they are starting to price themselves out of the market.Just a few negatives :-• Although the retractable roof over the pool area was  a fantastic idea, enabling the pool area to be covered in inclement weather, I found that even with the roof open in hot climates there was a distinct lack of air movement making the area rather hot and stuffy. This was strange given that there appeared to be many vents around that area but with no air seeming to be coming through them - maybe there was something wrong with the system.• Given the above, it would have been nice to have had some shaded areas up on the sun deck where you could sit on a lounger and enjoy the view and sea air without having the sun beating down on you.• I loved sitting on our balcony, reading and enjoying the view and sea air but found the hard, poorly shaped balcony chairs to be desperately uncomfortable - they need to have detachable cushions for the base and backrest.",Sail Date: December 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: South America|,"Chelmsford, United Kingdom"

Food quality has gone from a 4 Star in September to a 2.5 +/- depending on what venue you choose to dine in.  Most items on the buffet are warm at best where they use to be hot.  A Rueben sandwich use to have approximately about 1/2 inch of corn beef [the way it would be at any deli] instead there was 2 pieces of what looked like Buddig's dried corn beef slices on approximately 1.5 inch piece of bread.  Seriously lacking in what a Rueben actually is. Things  use to be about making everything as trouble free and enjoyable as possible.  It just is not happening now.  Maybe a world cruise record is destroying the Viking experience or just wearing the staff down or costing more than Viking expected.

Our choice was the Viking Sun Turquoise Cruise. We loved the Viking river cruise and wanted to test out their ocean cruising in a close to home stress free environment. The cruise did not disappoint. All that is good about Viking is evident in their ocean cruising. Since this was during the holiday break period the ship was full and there were families on board . All were in a festive mood. We booked late and took an explorer cabin in the stearn. Definitely a great choice! It is pricey but since this was our chill out vacation why not treat ourselves to the added luxury. Service on Viking is Top Notch. Booking in the explorer suite gave us guarantees in the specialty restaurants and in the spa. We also took advantage of the daily free laundry service. The transfers to and from the airport were flawless. The entertainment was great and our 'cruise director' was exceptional. appearing on staging and wowing us at our New Year's eve party on the pool deck. Afternoon tea is a true high tea with classical accompaniment. My husband became a fan...wow! There were two disappointments during the trip. The first was our first stop in the Florida keys. Looking forward to this to sample what could be future vacations. The docking is limited and through no fault of Viking we were denyed dock space due to a prior ship damaging the dock. The captain determined that the seas were too rough to use the launch however with diligent negotiations we did get into dock quite late but with a little taste of Key West. Some of the passengers experinced cancelled tours. The second was the port servicing Merida with our signature trip to Chichen Itza. Not only was the port very spare and poorly staffed but the tour to a world class site was terrible. The guide was ill prepared and left nothing for us to take home in terms of culture. The bus ride was tedious because everyone was feeling the disappointment. The other ports were great. Loved the remote Mayan village in Belize with knowledgeable docents on the bus portion of the tour and in the village. Even the lunch break was enjoyable. The Salsa Y Salsa tour in Cozamel was loads of fun and laughter and put us in a great party mood for New Year's eve.

Of course, Viking already are a multi-award winner for their river cruises which include the Rhine, Danube, Paris to the Swiss Alps, Paris and the heart of Normandy and Chateaux, Rivers and Wine.Now they are on the high seas and this ship is basically summed us as understated elegance. Attention to detail shows.Fine cuisine to suit all tastes plus excellent service is offered and Viking boast an all-inclusive deal including all on-board meals featuring regional specialities in a multiple choice of dining venues and times.Beer, wine and soft drinks with on-board lunch and dinner are included – you can upgrade to a spirits and premium wine package - along with free wi-fi. If you haven’t brought a laptop there are screens available on-board.An on-shore excursion is also included along with a programme of talks which aim to bring local history and culture to life.Guests we spoke to from countries including Mexico and Australia were full of praise for the experience and the repeat booking rates are high.No wonder, we strolled through spacious, well-appointed lounges with guests chilling, reading or planning trips.Several were working on a giant jigsaw and others were in the library, feet-up on leather loungers, reading. The library is always open.The spa is luxurious and nearby is an indoor pool with a built-in jacuzzi. A steam room was invitingly close along with a sauna. The spa complex also boasts a snow room – yes snow. Nordic tradition dictates that you alternate sauna bathing with cold dips or rolling in the snow.They say it detoxes the body, relaxes tired muscles and boosts circulation. I’ll take their word for that.Fitness classes are also available and include yoga, meditation, full-body workout and stretching, but some sidestep that and head for stylish coffee bars which are dotted around the ship, many with panoramic views.Images from the Bayeux Tapestry line the main staircase walls on the ocean ships and passengers can access information on weather, the next destination, restaurant menus and entertainment all on-line on large, conveniently sited screens around the high-tech ship.Our next port of call was the theatre where rehearsals were under way for a forthcoming production.It also doubles as a cinema and if the performance is full then it is beamed to a screen in one of the public areas.Sections can be screened off for small lectures and talks and a number of speakers are on board to offer information of history, architecture and local culture.Food is a major part of cruising. Of course, all this tempting food can stretch the waistline and the ship has a sizeable gym plus a personal trainer should you wish to shed some of those unwanted pounds.Sadly, my four-hour visit had to come to an end.

I discussed the excursions I wanted with the Viking sales rep prior to booking and was not told they were already sold out.  When I called to complain I was told to take the included tour. NO ONE GOES TO AFRICA TO RIDE A RUN DOWN BUS AROUND A DIRTY CITY.  The onboard excursion staff was a bit more understanding, but powerless to help us get the excursions we wanted.  And then, there is matter of the food. The issue is not the quality of the ingredients but rather the inability to serve a hot meal.  We gave up on the main dining room after 3 nights of having our dinner arrive cold.  Much the same was true at the buffet, even when the food trays were first put out, seemingly fresh from the kitchen, hot food was never not.  We ate from the cold buffet for most of meals.  The food served corrected was in the specialty restaurant.Viking's answer for having ruined a once in a lifetime trip to Africa - $250.  It was an insulting offer for a cruise that delivered nothing close to 5* experience and none of the excursions that were the reason we made the trip.

We have been spoiled traveling with National Geographic and Lindblad and have learned what well done shore excursions look like (you visit a museum and have a meeting with the curator or get a behind the scenes tour).  On the Sun, the excursions were the same as you get on any other mass market cruise ship.  I expected better, given Viking's cost and reputation.  The excursions weren't bad, they were just ordinary.

The service experience on board is first class. Our issues mainly relate to the arrangement and subsequent management of the cruise itself.The cruise was not marketed to us as the final leg of a world cruise, which is very significant. We did not appreciate this at all until late in the booking process. Initially this meant that we were unable to book the excursions we would have liked, as all the really exciting ones were long since fully booked when we were allowed access. It also meant that we found ourselves joining a cruise where most passengers were already starting to look forward to leaving when we got on board!A further issue in relation to the marketing of the cruise was the number of sea days, which was hidden in the correspondence. To exacerbate this, we then experienced additional sea days due to missing calls into Luderitz and Casablanca (see later) making a total of 16 sea days out of 28 days on the cruise - that's 60% of the time and nearly twice what we expected. Whilst it’s very nice to be on the ship, we did not expect to be sat around it quite as much as this!I laugh at the current Viking ads talking about how they spend ‘more time in port and less on the ship’. Not on a leg of a world cruise!The daily schedule always included 3 sessions of bridge, 3 sessions with knitting or crafting, and several other 'non-events' that were all for the world cruisers. This is very poor and well below our expectations, and what we have experienced elsewhere.We experienced a number of issues whilst on board, both with aspecsts of the food service and with maintenance issues. In the main issues raised were received with good grace, then ignored!!The cruise itinerary looked good when we booked but, apart from South Africa which was fabulous,  there were issues all along: we were unable to land in Luderitz due to slightly rough seas; Walvis Bay was OK but there really isn't much to see there at all; in Dakar, Senegal is we were told it was perfectly OK to take the shuttle bus into town so that's what we chose to do. This could not have been further from the truth. A frightening experience!; Santa Cruz Tenerife is a nice place but we managed to dock there on a holiday when 99% of shops were closed; Casablanca. Well what can I say! The Captain chose not to travel here due to a potential storm in the Bay of Biscay a few days later and he wanted to travel through the bay ahead of the storm. Whilst I understand this, in fact the risk appeared quite low and, as far as I could ascertain, the storm moved far to the north west by the time we would have travelled through the bay. This seemed to be an extraordinary and extremely ‘risk averse’ decision.In place of Casablanca the on-board team added Portsmouth into the itinerary. This caused ructions on board and I am not surprised. Further, when we challenged this decision on board, there was a sense that the entertainment staff felt it would appeal to the largely US passenger base. But for the British passengers on board this was a poor decision again. We almost decided to leave the ship in Portsmouth and I believe some Brits did so!The outcome of the above change is that, as well as missing out a key port on the cruise, we then ended up with nearly 2 full days of excess time to 'lose' in the English Channel before the ship was due into Greenwich. At times we were barely moving. So, we spent the last 5 days of our cruise travelling only a few hundred miles, very close to the UK!Summarising the itinerary overall, the time in South Africa was great, but the rest of the Western Africa experience was a big let-down and for about the last 10 days of our cruise it felt like the ship was operating a ‘close down’ routine. We loved the ship and the core Viking experience, but we have not received what we expected. As a British passenger on this cruise we were definitely second-class citizens overall, which is not what you expect at this huge cost!I am a few weeks from our return home when posting this note. That’s because I took the trouble to write directly to Mr Torstein Hagen, Chairman of Viking Cruises, because I felt there were a large number of issues that the company should be aware of in planning future cruises.Having taken the time to write personally to an executive of the company I did not expect to receive a letter from a customer services agent a full month later. The response made light of the very serious concerns that we raised, IGNORED the key issues, and had the audacity at one point to refer to ‘force majeure’.I wrote again the chairman and, a few weeks later, received a further letter from customer services basically telling me to go away!Viking cruises have an astounding inability to listen and respond the like I have not come across with any other company. They are not listening to their customers and will thus not achieve their very high ambitions for the business! Responding to concerns should not be an exercise in ‘customer relations speak’: it’s an opportunity to turn a concerned customer into a real advocate, but right now they have succeeded in creating a significant detractor.",Sail Date: April 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Africa|,"Worcestershire, United Kingdom"

Our cruise was, as we found out after booking it, a 23 day segment of a 123 day World Cruise. Approximately half of the just under 900 passengers departed with us in Buenos Aires and were presumably replaced with others.We liked the design of the Sun which we found quite similar to the river longships - just a whole lot larger. The cuisine on the Sun was the best we ever experienced aboard any ship. Dinners were superb and the menus were varied enough to please most pallets. There are two specialty restaurants, Manfredis (Italian) and the Chef's Table (revolving menus) that require reservations but no extra charge. We ate in Manfredis three times during during our trip and the Chef's Table twice. Manfredis is the better option, with a delicious Ossa Buca (also appeared one night at the main restaurant) and a terrific ribeye steak, among many other options, including veal saltimbocca, marsala, or parmigiana. Sadly, the actual table service - across all the dining venues - was inconsistent, ranging from good to amateurish, but rarely very good. The bar service personnel were far more professional. Do look for the special dinner and lunch offerings that move around from the pool area to the aft pool from time to time.While Viking provided beer (Carlsberg on this trip) and a revolving white and red wine each night, I recommend opting for the Silver Spirits program (approximately $20 per person per day) for a better, unlimited selection of wines and spirits (up to $15 per drink). On this topic, the by-the-glass wine options were limited to $6 per glass options and featured a relatively inexpensive selection of whites and reds - basically, these are wines that many of us purchase in the $10-$20 range retail. There are scores of good sparkling wines available on the market that should be offered, other than the Prosecco and a generic private Viking label  - after all, Viking tries hard to present a refined, upscale environment onboard which is somewhat diluted by an average <$10 bottle of Prosecco. To add insult to injury, Viking inexplicitly lists a Drappier Carte d'Or brut on the drink menu for $16 per glass - $1 over the Silver Spirit limit, which does not allow a pay-the-difference option. Sorry, but that's just tacky. On our last river cruise, we enjoyed Veuve Cliquot throughout the cruise - perhaps that's why they changed the program!That leads me to the entertainment options offered that we found to be quite thin. There was a ""Viking Band"". While all were skilled musicians - a drummer, keyboard player, guitarist, and bass player with a male and female vocalists; we found the band to be similar to what one would find at a wedding. They played cover tunes adequately and provided the primary entertainment in the mostly under-utilized Torchavn lounge most nights. We were disappointed that the ship did not provide any jazz music aside from the excellent recorded mix during the over-the-top brunch event. There were several other ship singers (I think four) that functioned mainly as emcees for the daily at sea trivia contests and performed at a few atrium concerts - including a tantalizingly wonderful female jazz singer (she performed ""What a Difference a Day Makes"" at a staff recital). We asked her why there was no jazz onboard and she replied that the rather steely Cruise Director had given the ""go ahead"" to do a show or two but they never materialized and the ship's band - whose pianist was quite fond of Rachmaninoff - proved to be utterly incapable of playing jazz anyway. Other regular performers included the obligatory classical duo - two lovely young women who were very good if that's your thing, it's not ours; a wonderfully talented solo guitarist, the irrepressibly lovely Minky G; and a classically styled pianist who apparently was also quite fond of Rachmaninoff. For our taste, Minky G was our usual and only option. Guest entertainers included a guy that curiously played Billy Joel in a Broadway and West End ""Moving Out"" production - he played well but neither looked nor sounded anything close to Mr. Joel. A magician performed a couple of shows to what we heard was a half-filled theater - we passed, and a troupe of young cloggers performed whatever it is that cloggers do. The audience participation in that event proved to be the highlight. There was one brilliant guest performer, Savannah Smith, a Vegas-styled act who simply crushed it with her performance of updated standards.The ship's singers did perform a rather ersatz Beatles revue, poorly backed by the ship band. Clearly, people do not choose Viking for the entertainment. Better were the so-called ""Enrichment Lectures"", featuring a terrific wildlife expert, Robin, a cruise ship historian (excellent, btw - Bill Miller), a world historian, a retired pilot who ran a simulated flight for us on screen, I'm forgetting others except the star of this cruise, the great (imo) Roger McGuinn, the co-founder of The Byrds and a long-time performer, writer, studio musician, and folkie. Mr. McGuinn's four multi-media presentations, accompanied by his live playing, were most enjoyable - a veritable folk-rock history. He, and his lovely wife Camilla, were very visible and gracious throughout the cruise. Mr. McGuinn was on board as a lecturer, not a performer, so his lectures were all morning affairs.Sea days were well-spent at the noon-time trivia matches where we bonded with our teammates, the wonderful inclusive spa, the pool areas, or simply walking the deck. The spa has a heated mineral pool and hot tub, an ice room, steam room, and multi-directional shower in addition to his and hers locker rooms with a sauna and ice-cold plunge pool. Other activities were available as well including a popular afternoon tea in the beautiful, but also under-utilized Wintergarden.Included tours were generally about two hours and it depended on who your guide was as to the quality. It should be noted that the ports on this cruise were not regular stops for Viking, so there was really no set process. We opted for several extra ship tours and were generally satisfied with those. Port-intensive cruises, on a regular schedule, may offer better options.While my wife and I are both retired, we're fairly recently retired. Clientele on this cruise tended to be of the long, long retired set and I'd be surprised if some of them  make it to the end of the 4-1/2 month World Cruise. We personally witnessed at least six falls by the very elderly during our 23+2 post day segment - not trips, but just drop-to-the-floor collapses. This age difference obviously contributed to my overall rating, I guess we're the ""tweeners"" now! We were simply not impressed by what we ultimately found to be a rather stuffy faux-elegant ambiance on-board - all very Nordic. In fact, one of the primary draws for us to Viking is the casual attire policy on all nights. While I appreciate the casual attire, the rather formal, stiff atmosphere - only amplified by the ever-present classical music performers left this cruiser a bit hesitant about returning. We're not big party people, nor are we gamblers, but a little jazz would have been nice in the evenings - and could I at least get a cookie late at night?! As nice as the public areas appeared to be, we never did find a regular spot on board that we felt comfortable for a evening cocktail. Perhaps instead of trying too hard to cultivate an upscale image, the line may consider actually creating comfortable areas that may appeal to a wider interests.In summary: excellent cuisine, well-designed public areas, and a small passenger count were the main positives relating specifically to the ship. Inconsistent service, flat entertainment, and a very limited wine selection by-the-glass were my main dislikes. Overall, value is relative to what ones' expectations are. Let's call it a break-even.We had a Deluxe Veranda - the ""deluxe"" meant we had a coffee maker, a cashmere blanket, and mini-bar daily restocked (sans alcohol), otherwise, the cabins are identical to the other non-suite cabins. The room was quite Nordic with an efficient, but tight, design. The closet doors rattling woke me up in the early going, but I got used to it. The bathroom was nice with fine European finishes and fixtures and a heated tile floor. I can't even imagine how someone could make it around the world in that cabin!",Sail Date: January 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: South America|,"Port Saint Lucie, Florida"

Didn't get to see anything of Bali.We purchased the silver wine package which was suppossed to offer premium wines according to their brochures.  That was also misleading  the wines they offered under that package were everyday average wines,  no one bottle retails for more than $15.Entertainment was average.  The excursions they include with the cruise were very poor and superficial, hardly saw anything and we didn't spend enough time in any port.  The Dome shows which promised to be interesting were really bad technologically, the room is too small for a 3D effect and everything was distorted.  Another disappointment.  The service was uninterested and at time actually rude, particularly the wait staff in the restaurants, sometimes they ignored you, sometimes argued with the passengers or gave  a smart answer like ""I only have two hands"",   really bad.  The Customer Service Team, with a couple of exceptions wasn't much better, when I asked them to correct errors they had made in the disembarkation card they told me to do it myself.  Overall the food was OK, no fabulous.  Very disappointed with Chef's Table which is supposed to be a specialty restaurant.

So, obviously, we have been very happy with them.  We have come to expect beautiful ships and helpful polite staff and this trip certainly lived up to our expectations in those areas. Our cabin stewards and the waiters were hard working and cheerful.  I love the sleek style of the ships.  There were some maintenance issues.  One elevator was out of order the entire 4 weeks.  The hot tub was out of order 3 of the 4 times I went to use it.  One of the washing machines on my deck was not working properly.  Our tour, ""Far East Explorations"" was actually 2 cruises.  The first 2 weeks, ""Far East Horizons"" was an uneven experience.  The second 2 weeks, ""Far East Discovery"" was much better.Full disclosure:  We complained to Viking about 4 excursions after we returned home and they gave us shipboard credit for a future cruise equal to the cost of the tours.  What could not be remedied, though, is the precious time that we wasted on these tours when we could have spent our time seeing other sights.From the start, the first part of the trip felt poorly organized.  They scheduled a stop in Korea on a national holiday.  Eventually they realized this and notified us of a change in the itinerary, but wouldn't you think they would know about this before they set up the cruise?  They also notified us before the cruise that an excursion we had selected had been cancelled ""for operational reasons"" and that the order of 2 ports was being switched.  The ""Ultimate Hiroshima"" tour took us to Miyajima to see the floating torii gate. It is being renovated and is covered up.  This started in June and will likely continue for 2 years.  I see in Viking's listings that they are still offering this excursion.  (See photo). Be aware that you cannot see the gate.On the ""Shimabara and Mt. Unzen"" tour, we were driven about 2 hours from Nagasaki.  The description mentioned things we did not see at all, such as ""beautiful carp streams and traditional teahouses.""  But the worst part was the hot springs.  The description said ""You can enjoy a dip at the nearest ryokan,"" but when the excursion director saw us heading to the outing with towels, he said there would be no time for that.  The hot springs were mostly empty.  What was visible was pipes carrying the hot water to nearby hotels and spas.  (See photo).The ""Hong Kong After Dark"" tour started at 4:15 p.m.!  It. Was. Not.

Boarding was delightful after 1 day in Vancouver and our stateroom was perfect. This ship is immaculate and the crew friendly and helpful. Loved the many stations for hand sanitizing. Dining was amazing and varied. I recommend the World Cafe as well as the specialty options. We dined 4 times at Manfredi's and Chef's Table. Unless you drink a lot, don't purchase the Silver Beverage Package. You are offered wine, beer, soft drinks, water at lunch and dinner. Refills of all beverages during meals. Afternoon Tea at the Wintergarden should not be missed. Variety of teas, scones, finger sandwiches and pastries are perfectly prepared. Live music: pianist, guitarist, violin/viola duo played beautifully at 3 different venues.Don't miss the Explorer's Dome and programs presented there. Sadly, it has limited seating so if you don't sign up INSTANTLY you will miss out. That's my major criticism.  Included off shore excursions are OK. The options are expensive and consider carefully. Lots to do onboard. The port calls at Valdez and Seward are rather dull unless you're ready for the big adventures involving helicopters, etc.The transfer to Anchorage for flights home was well organized.

We selected a Penthouse Junior Suite, stateroom 7016.  The room was spacious, very well appointed with ample storage space (6 bags fit easily beneath the bed), and the room was everything we had hoped it would be.  Our stateroom was immediately off the elevator lobby and on the same deck as the Wintergarden, the pool deck (with both bar and grill), the World Cafe (buffet) and the Aquavit Terrace and the infinity pool.  Forward is Mamsen's and the lower level of the Explorers Lounge (and bar).  Room was just about perfectly situated.  The Restaurant is on Deck 2 aft, with the specialty dining restaurants (all included in the cruise fare at no extra charge) are located on Deck 1 adjacent to the Viking Living Room (lowest level of the 3-level atrium) and the Explorers Desk (the front office / concierge).  With just 930 passengers the ship never felt crowded or in any way overwhelming.  No casino, no ice-skating, no rock-climbing wall, no bumper cars, no children, and about 3,000 fewer passengers than you might find on the newer mega-ships -- just how we wanted and very much enjoyed.  Only one port of call required a tender (at Icy Strait Point) and that was just a part of our overall experience, fascinating to observe and be a part of).  The Viking staff were uniformly pleasant, helpful, friendly and hard-working, both on the ship and ashore helping to coordinate the shore excursions.  Our itinerary included these ports of call: Seward, Valdez, cruising Hubbard Glacier, Icy Strait Point, Skagway, Juneau, Sitka, Ketchikan, and Vancouver, BC.  Definitely two thumbs up.

Why would a cruise line take passengers out of the country to board a ship that is sailing in the U.S?  We would never take any cruise again from the Vancouver docks.  The accommodations to check in a large number of people is not there.  We waited in lines for hours and walked about 3 miles according to our fitbits.  We are used to the Viking River Cruises where the line has a huge presence at the ports where they dock.  This is not the case for Viking Ocean Cruises in Alaska. Unfortunately, this terrible introduction to Viking  affected our total experience and view of Viking Ocean Cruises.  That being said, the ship was beautiful. Our suite was one of the nicest ones that we've ever had on a cruise and the service we received from the housekeeping department was outstanding.  We ate 6 nights in the two specialty restaurants.  They were only average. We were in Alaska where there was an abundance of salmon and halibut but these dishes were not reflected in the menus of any of the restaurants. There was little variety of menus in these specialty restaurants. Also the waiters in the restaurants were as well trained as they should have been.  They didn't anticipate the needs of the diners.  For example, They served us coffee but didn't offer cream or sugar.   The choice of excursions was varied and interesting. Alaska is so beautiful and the guides so well informed and friendly.  We saw bears and whales and sled dogs. We flew in a seaplane over glaciers and had a wonderful salmon lunch at a lodge.  We took an antique train on the route to the Yukon.

Total payment was made by January 2018. In December 2018 I found out all shore excursions covered by the trip cost were no longer available.  Also airline arrangements made by Viking did not allow me enough time to transfer in San Francisco to  the international flight. I was charged an additional $476 for their mistake, Total cost of the trip was $8639. Both of us purchased travel insurance through Viking. In late December 2018 I developed leg pain/difficulty walking. After consulting with an orthopedic surgeon, surgery was indicated. The trip was out. When I contacted Viking to cancel the trip I was informed that my room mate would have to pay single supplement and a cancelation fee because of my cancelation. This amounted to >$5000. When I pointed out that we both had travel insurance they insisted she had to pay. She did pay an additional $5000+ in order to go on the cruise. Eventually, some 4 months later I received partial reimbursement of the trip cost. To  date my room mate has received partial reimbursement of her $5000.I have never dealt with a more snarky group of personnel in the travel business.I have traveled internationally since the 1940's. I have been on many cruises to the Caribbean, Mediterranean, Adriatic. I have traveled with groups, Georgetown Medical,  Bar Association, Bankers Association. I have traveled alone to Europe, Asia, Middle East, South America. I have never had to cancel a trip until this year. However, I have had people cancel on me. I have never paid a cancelation fee, single supplement etc. I had the cabin/hotel room to myself because we both had travel insurance. That's why I paid for travel insurance.

Our Viking phone sales agent assured us it would be a room equal to or better than a ""JPS"" that we had occupied on a previous cruise.  We paid for a room of 405 sf and that is not anywhere near the footage in the room we got.  We measured.  It was actually so much smaller.  This should never be classified as a Junior Penthouse Suite.There was no notification until the day before we left that our room was a handicapped room.  The room fell far short of 405 sf and was horribly configured so as to present tripping hazards and reduce livable space.    There is no info on the Viking website to allow a consumer to see what the handicapped room looks like.  You  are supposed to call them.  How is that supposed to be helpful?  Why not have a handicapped floorplan on the site?  It is not a matter of one less television (as the second unhelpful Customer Service Representative claimed).  The entire room was a major handicap for anyone not in a wheelchair.  There are only 2 handicapped rooms on the entire ship and they are 6020 and 6021.  Folks, stay away from these rooms unless you need to have a room to accommodate a wheelchair.  Otherwise, it is a very inferior room in every respect.To make the voyage endurable, we needed to bring in the balcony table and try to arrange it so we could have room service or utilize a table of some sort.  Watching the television required us to sit on the bed.  Every other room on the entire ship has a sitting area and a sofa of some sort; not so here with these handicapped rooms.Viking contacted us twice with very inadequate offers to settle, if we would sign a non-disclosure agreement.  Needless to say, we did not accept their offers and do not think we'd ever travel with Viking again (in this life).As we talked with ther travelers, we learned that Viking has a reputation for being a mid-level economy cruise line (not up to the level of Regent and Seabourne) and our dining companions were not impressed with Viking.  It's amazing what people will share during dinner.On other occasions (conversation in the laundry room, etc.) the popular opinion was that Viking is growing too quickly and the quality and care is just not what it used to be.  There were a lot of unhappy people and these had been Viking cruisers with several trips under their belts.   One of our opinions about Viking is that the ships are all cookie-cutter (tract houses on water) and if you travel on one, you know them all, down to the most miniscule detail.  Even the meals are the same: Manfredi's menus did not change from the time we sailed with them to Stockholm.Travel is all about having new experiences and that includes variety in the sea-going vessels.  When we complained to the ship's General Manager, he read to us the complaint letter he sent to Viking's home office on our behalf.  In that transmittal, he told them that there has been problems with this room in the past.  Viking knew about this problem and allowed it to continue. Check your tickets.  Go through a travel agent.  Don't let this happen to you.  Viking sales agents get paid a commission and it is in their interest to fill those non-saleable rooms.  A travel agent will protect you from this kind of bait-and-switch and deceptive business practice we believe was our experience with Viking booking staff.It has been 2 months since our ill-fated cruise.  We chalked this up to a really bad experience and a lesson well-learned.  Viking Customer Service left a lot to be desired and did not rectify our compaints.  My advise: use a travel agent.

The company flew the London plane direct, but the Manchester and Scotland flight had tto change meaning we lost a day due travel time. The shop staff were friendly until the last evening! Never went to the evening entertainment but the word was not great except for the outside entertainment. Food was great as it always is, Fred's ships are not for family but over 40s. Been on lots of ships Fred is the best of the small ships, remember small ships get into places big ones can't. Our favourite place was Porbandar Fred is the only ship to visit due to the shallow water, you get to see local life, as it is, some do visit as its Gandi birth place. Mumbi is a mad place, there is no smoking and vaping is band, we used sterling the hole 2weeks except for £10 we changed. We had a photo shoot done, best value for money of top quality photos.",Sail Date: February 2020|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Indian Ocean|,"St Andrews, United Kingdom"

We arrived tired, hot, thirsty in temperatures of 32°C and still wearing or carrying the winter clothes that we had worn when we had left Britain in temperatures of 2°C early the previous morning. All that we wanted was a friendly face, a welcome, a drink and the chance to lie down in the cool of our cabins. But instead, we forced to queue in searing equatorial temperatures of 32°C carrying winter coats and hand-luggage and forced by the ship’s photographers to walk through their “pop-up” photo booth as we tried to get onto the ship. They just wouldn’t take a polite “No thank you!” for an answer. They were irritatingly persistent even to the extend of standing in front of people to force them to pose for a photo. It was a dreadfully inconsiderate way to greet joining passengers. It would have been really lovely to have had a welcome from the Cruise Director, his assistant, one of his hosts or… anyone… from his team on arrival… but clearly our Cruise Director didn’t consider us to be that important… despite the fact that, as a whole, those who joined at Bali must have boosted Fred’s coffers by a small fortune. Our welcome “evening highlights” was a “general knowledge quiz” at 10.00 pm that night! Our “featured entertainment” was “a night in Bali under the stars” which comprised of 45 mins piano music on the back deck or the Boudicca Orchestra… again on the back deck … while we were far, far away at second sitting dinner. It was a really, really, really poor start to a fortnight cruise that had cost us over £10,000. In the past, other ships have given us the warmest of welcomes after a long flight and have offered a locally inspired barbeque with local music and cocktails as an alternative to a very late formal meal. The next night was a little better. Our evening “showtime” was entitled “a taste of things to come” and we were invited to join our “Cruise Director” as he introduced our “entertainment team.” The first part of this was everybody who was anybody, including the craft instructor, the ukulele teacher and the chaplain selling their wares. This is the first time that we have every had a chaplain who was considered to be an “entertainer!” The first part of the evening was a disappointingly boring, tedious waste of our time and it was really clear that our cruise director was just filling in time because he didn’t have any actual “entertainment” for us. There were a few disjointed songs by the show company to follow but these were just bits and bobs that we were to see again as part of proper shows on other evenings. So, after two days, we were seriously wondering if we had made a major expensive mistake in booking this cruise.On the more positive side… everything seemed better after the Captain’s welcome reception on day three. He was charming, amusing, delightful and welcoming. There were lots of top-ups, tray after tray of nice nibbles and the good humour of the Captain really saved the cruise and seemed to win the audience over. Throughout the entire cruise, the Captain and his senior officers circulated and were very proactive in meeting and chatting to passengers. It was really encouraging to see the Captain joined for lunch with some of his crew one day in the dining room. The itinerary was very good…. because we paid out for excellent excursions. We enjoyed Bali, Singapore, Phuket, Yangon and Sir Lanka.  There was a wide a range of excursions on offer at all ports and so we were able to choose things that would interest us. One excursion was cancelled but we were able to have another on in its place. The Boudica is now one of the oldest ladies of seas and even predates ABBA winning the Eurovision Song Contest.… the Boudica was built in 1973 for luxury cruises all over the world and still has a great deal of that classic elegance despite having been lengthened. The ambiance was very pleasant and the areas refurbished more recently are in keeping with the traditional glory days of cruising. Our cabin, the public areas on board and the ship as a whole was really immaculate and some of the interior areas were very attractively decorated. The lighting on the ship had been significantly revamped since we last cruised on the Boudicca and the lighting effects made the ship immensely attractive night.Staff were friendly and it was clear that many of them were working efficiently and exceptionally hard. The  senior officers were often around the ship and were very approachable and convivial. The Captain, both in his formal presentations at cocktail parties and receptions, and when we met him around the ship was exceptionally pleasant and there could be no doubt that he was a man on a mission to ensure that his passengers were looked after as well as they could possibly be.The food was “good” throughout. The breakfast selection was extensive, lunch buffets had improved since our last cruise with Fred and the presentation and the quality of food at dinner was better. The Chef and his team were able to provide well cooked, attractively presented dishes and, more importantly, to provide menus and specials reflecting the areas that we were travelling. The chef also put on a great Gala Buffet on lunchtime and really tasty buffets at receptions and events. Fred’s advertising promised us “deliciously-tempting dishes – expertly crafted by our chefs” and to be fair his chefs did produce a well cooked fish, chips and mushy peas one evening for dinner and a decent curry on another evening. However, in our opinion, these menus are not fine-dining, not up to the level of a gastro-pub and they just don’t justify the cost we paid of about £700 a day. We also felt that the menus compared poorly with what Fred’s competitors are now offering. We also ate in “The Grill” one evening and the steak was the best that we’ve ever had on a Fred Olsen cruise boat… it is just such a pity that we had to pay £20 each extra to eat there, had to pay for our wine and the waiter seemed to expect that we should leave a tip when… Fred’s competitors offer speciality dining, wines and gratuities as part of the cruise price.Some of the entertainment on board was outstanding. Leo Andrew with his songs from the musicals and his entrancing tales from the shows was really lovely and the amazing virtuoso violin of Orpheus Leander… who could thrill with excerpts from the Four Seasons or stunning gypsy music… were both outstanding. A “Myanmar Local Show” was authentic, fascinating and enjoyable. The Boudicca Show Company put on two absolutely stunning production shows… parts of which would not have been out of place on a West End stage.  There were a number of wonderful late night cabarets from Show Company members, from the superbly talented Connor Wilson and the immensely talented Jasmine Espina… who spends her days on board as a bar waitress. We were less keen on the comedian Taffy Spencer because we’d seen his show years ago and it was still much the same. Taffy was down to host the “Night of Variety” at the end of the cruise but the Cruise Director did that instead… Taffy may have been much better.The Cruise Director seemed to think that that he was a very funny comedian… perhaps he was in a 1970s holiday camp sort of style. We’ve had the same cruise director on previous occasions and, despite the fact that Fred has lots of clients who have cruised with him again and again and again, this cruise director still repeats the same very, very, very old staid quips and “jokes” to nothing more than a slight twitter and a very limp reaction from the audience. We had paid for a luxury cruise experience… he offered a little bit of second-hand “Hi de Hi” like in a second-rate bargain-basement holiday camp. On one formal evening he asked for applause to congratulate the gentlemen for being so well turned-out… the vast majority were in immaculate dinner suits and formal shoes while the cruise director himself stood on stage in scruffy heavy soled shoes, down-at-the heal trousers and a green velvet “smoking jacket’ affair that at least looked as if it had come from a1970s jumble sale. It was such a pity… when the officers, crew and the vast majority of the passengers had made such an effort to be well dressed for such an occasion that the Cruise director looked as if he just didn’t want to be part of it. Throughout the holiday, some aspects of the planning and organisation of our entertainment was far short of perfect. For days after we had joined the ship, photographs of guest entertainers were advertised who had already left and we were never to see.  The electronic “Daily Times” was often a day late and so was totally, utterly useless. One excursion was cancelled so late in the day that we were only alerted after the shore-excursion desk had closed and it was also closed all of the following day. We turned on our cabin monitor to watch one lecture and found that the sound was obliterated by pop music being played over the top of the lecturer. This just gave the impression that someone somewhere in charge of these things just didn’t care, didn’t respect the cruisers and just didn’t appreciate the millions of pounds that we, and others, were jointly paying for the “experience.”Hygiene was exceptional good and better than the vast majority of cruise ships that we’ve been on. The ship seems to have people cleaning and sterilising 24 hours a day. We were provided with facemasks if we wanted them, hand sanitisers were provided on every excursion and cleaning towels were provided were we got back onto the ship and everyone had to use hand sanitiser before they were allow up the gangway. It was really reassuring.There were a few niggles: it was irritating that we couldn’t play a port talk back on the cabin monitor, the Wi-Fi was expensive and unreliable. The telly often didn’t work. It seemed a bit mean that a scoop of ice-cream cost £1.50 on top of the £10,000+ that we had already paid for the cruise. The much vaunted ribs were never offered and so never used. However, the biggest bug-bear throughout the cruise was the photographers who staked us every time that we left the ship, stood in our way as we rushed to join excursions, forced us to walk through their “pop-up” booth if we wanted to go to the Captain’s welcome party, on one occasion, if we wanted to reach any of the restaurants. At dinner one evening, one of them, dressed like a four year old playing pirates, seemed to enjoy sneaking up behind people as they were eating while another one of the photographers forced themselves on people despite any request to desist. Never on any cruise line at any time in the last 30 or 40 cruises have we come across a set of photographers who were so persistently unpleasant and aggressive. It was only after complaints by passengers to the senior management team in the restaurant that these photographers were forced to respect passengers. Tips are still added to cabin accounts despite the fact that Fred’s UK competitors have stopped this immensely unpopular practice. On this occasion they were added to our account at the end of the cruise despite us having already signed a waver form. We had to remind Guest Services twice more to remove tips from our bill. We much prefer to reward good service personally. Overall impressions… the Boudicca has an outstanding Captain, excellent senior officers, a friendly and efficient crew and some excellent entertainers. We felt that the ship was potentially an attractive, stylish, ideally sized, very classy vintage ocean cruiser which could offer; friendly efficient service, an elegant ambiance, spacious surroundings, stunning itineraries and top class entertainment. The Boudica had a unique quality that could easily make it really special in a way that no other company could now match. However, the poor welcome on arrival, two days with second rate entertainment, inconsiderate photographers, misinformation on notice boards, and an out of date electronic “Daily Times” gave a very poor impression of the organisation of the holiday. Add some very uncompetitive additional changes and the need to constantly remind Guest Service about “gratuities” and we weren’t so surprised that on one of the last evenings the Cruise Director let slip that the ship was sailing with empty cabins and was hundreds of cruisers below capacity.",Sail Date: January 2020|Cabin Type: Suite|Type of Trip: |Destination: Indian Ocean|,"London, United Kingdom"

Most staff very professional,  helpful and friendly. Guest Services staff are slightly dismissive/patronising and I’m unsure as to whether this was due to language problems or lack of knowledge. Embarked at Bali and process was reasonably straightforward, prompt delivery of luggage to cabin. Outside cabin deck 4 was OK for me as I was travelling solo but would be ‘snug’ for two. Always kept clean and tidy but again slightly dated. Restaurants provided excellent food and service. I was disappointed that I had not been allocated an 8 seat table with other solo travellers. Initially I was on a 4 seat table but only one other passenger attended. After he stated he was probably going to ask to be moved to earlier sitting, I ask maitre d’ to find me a place on a solo travellers table. He stated he was unable to help. I then spoke with Overall Restaurant Manager who arranged for me to move to a 6 seat table. This consisted of a mother and daughter and two sisters. Luckily for me they were great company but I could so easily have ended up with passengers who did not make me feel welcome or included me in their conversations etc. Two days later I discovered that another solo traveller had been reallocated to a table of 8 solo travellers. When travelling solo, dining in the evening with other solo travellers is very important, especially for a 4 week tour. I think Fred Olsen are missing a trick in making solo travellers feel included even though they have solo get togethers a couple of mornings earlier in tour. The first port was not very interesting and this could have been dropped to allow 2 days in Fremantle to allow passengers to visit both Fremantle and Perth. Albany would have been a good first stop. As said I would have liked more time at Fremantle/Perth. Kangaroo Island was great for wild life. Two days in Melbourne was memorable. Hobart was great as was the working Animal Sanctuary (not a zoo), close up experience with wombats, Tasmanian devils, koalas and kangaroos, all waiting to recover and be returned to wild. Fantastic 3 days in Sydney over New Year. Excellent view of NY eves fireworks from the ship. Docked close to Darling Quay and easy to use public transport. Manley was a fascinating place to visit. Enjoyed Brisbane, great shopping, river cruise etc. Townsville not really a tourist place and extra day in Cairns for those disembarking there would have been better.  Cairns looked an interesting place to explore but, as I had booked Kuranda Rail and Sky Rail tour did not get back to ship until mid afternoon and needed to pack ready for 07:00 departure the following day was unable to do so. If you wish to tour Australia without having to unpack every other day, this cruise is a very good idea. Feedback from other passengers in their prebooked tours, was that they were expensive, a lot of them could have been amended to allow more time for exploring, lunching etc. I felt that Kuranda/Sky Rail tour could have started earlier and not had an ‘extra’ stop at cathedral, allowing us to return to ship at 13:00, therefore giving time to explore Cairns independently in the afternoon. As we were travelling during the wildfires disasters, I was shocked, when I asked Guest Services if they could arrange for passengers to make charity donations in this respect, I was informed that only Head Office could authorise this but I should make an online donation. As WiFi on board was expensive and using public WiFi to access your bank account etc is not very secure, I did not want to risk it. I discovered that Woolworths Stores were taking donations for this cause and I was able to do this in Brisbane. Late into the cruise the ship held a fun day to enable passengers to make donations etc. I suppose better late than never. Passengers seemed to age from late forties upwards of varying health levels, some appeared to find getting around very difficult. I was amused to see a group of five ladies daily knitting in one of the lounges. There are plenty and variable daily activities held on board. The staff at the spa were excellent and great value. The gym provided good appropriate equipment. I was not impressed by yoga class, no warm up/down and tutor did not take into account varying levels of participants, pushing some beyond their abilities. I found the entertainment amateurish especially the staff performers, high school choreography and although they could all sing well as individuals they lacked harmony. I think Fred Olsen need to consider reassessing their dining arrangements and take into consideration the demographics of their future clients. I got the feeling they have their procedures in place for their older thinking passengers but they need to update these for passengers who are more independent and of a younger outlook.",Sail Date: December 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: |Destination: Australia|,"Canvey Island, United Kingdom"

Food was good, but you have to choose between 6.15, too early, and 8.30, too late.  Had a successful table of 6.   We had the all-inclusive drinks package which was generally good but the wines were definitely not top class.  One problem was the Andaman Islands.

We asked several questions that if we were not wanting to go ashore at Port Blair we were told that Fred Olsen would not allow us to get on the boat as we HAD to have a full visa (a greater cost than the Indian e-visa)  So we had to buy the Visas.  We asked for our bed to be made up as a double bed, I was told by two members of staff that they would not do that unless my tour operator asked them to do it - so we got the company to request it.   I sent a letter off about Olsen's reaction as to waste people's time later when we got on and then change the cabin again is crazy !!   So we got on ....... but Fred Olsen ignored the request, and even the cabin stewardess was unhappy that they had to change it again.   Next thing !!!  We then find out that people on board never had any correct Indian Visas at all, and quite a few had the wrong Visas - were they refused to get on board - no. Anyone can just get on (so being told that we HAD to have them was rubbish again.    It just goes to show that the Head office try and create more mayhem for anyone else who arranged their trip - other than via Fred Olsen direct.    BUT ............  the staff on board were helpful, caring and their conduct was very good indeed.   Having travelled on so many cruises I find that Fred Olsen were the worst Head office staff ever.

We booked via the RHS (Royal Horticultural Society)  and their talks and events were excellent.  Having only been on one cruise many years ago we were expecting the same 5* luxury, especially having booked a suite.  But we were disappointed, we were told by an honest senior crew member that we must not expect 5* accommodation or dining this is a 3* ship. Our bathroom, despite asking for a separate shower, only had one over the bath and the whole bathroom was very tired.  Do not be comforted by talk of refurbs these are small and there is nothing you can seriously do to a 47 year old ship.  Food was ok not special and always in a very busy restaurant. Effectively there is just one dining room plus an outside grill.  This saved the day for us on three occasions with fine food but it is outside so often not open. It also had a very very limited menu that does not change and this at an extra £20 a head. However the choice of three steaks were excellent.   The ship is well run our room was clean and comfortable but the client demographic was old certainly 70 plus and often felt like a care home as so many passengers had to use walking aids and wheel chairs.  Almost exclusively British passengers almost exclusively Philippine staff who were very good, fun and efficient.  Lots of entertainment and activities meant there was always something to do when the ship was at sea.  The mainly British senior staff were very good and Guest manager Debbie made our time on board very pleasant as she understood us and our disappointment. We could not have been handled better.

As advised we went to see if we could upgrade and it was not an easy or friendly meeting. the long and short they wanted more than the difference in the cabin rates - and the ship was half empty.We had also booked the drinks package - not a good deal as it is very limited to unknown brands - not good value.Food was at best average it seemed that after the round africa cruise the kitchen was using what was left, we have been on about 10 cruises nd this is by far the worst food of any.The cruise itself turned out to be in the wake of a terrible storm in the Atlantic - not Olsen's fault and the cruise had an extended stay in Cadiz and a stop in Lisbon then back to Southampton, cancelling the nothern Spannish ports.As we left Cadiz the workers on the ship started dismantling cabins and there were miles of cables on the walkways - seemed dangerous especially in Force 10 weather - thinking in case of emergency. We did complain to no avail.Next the numbers in the dinning room were dwindling and it was getting emptier, people were complaining about the quality.

It really was a floating care home. There were no activities or evening shows even remotely suitable for the under 70s; it was all bridge, knitting, and very bad easy listening piano music. The ship is old too. The decor is what I'd expect of a Travelodge, with garish patterned carpets and cheap furniture. The cabins have tiny, horrible bathrooms with shower curtains and no toiletries except soap, which is awful considering the price. It's also impossible to turn off, or turn down, the noisy, powerful air-conditioning, so the air in the cabins is desiccated, and I didn't get a single night's unbroken sleep.Value for money was non-existent. Everything cost more, and nothing was included except meals. They were charging £50 for a week's Wifi -- and Wifi isn't reliable at sea anyway. No TV signal most of the time, and a very, very limited selection of films. Soft drinks were extra, alcohol was extra, gym classes were extra, many on board activities were extra: and the cruise line was charging more than twice the amount for shore excursions than it cost to book them independently. From minute one, I felt like they were penny pinching; whatever they advertise, this is absolutely not a luxury experience.The staff were brilliant and friendly, and the food was wonderful. I was really concerned, though, that every staff member in a remotely senior position was a white man, while all the waiters and cleaning staff were from the Philippines -- I suspect being paid much less than they should have been. Especially from older passengers, I saw and overhead quite a lot of patronising racism. It was just mortifying to watch.This was my first cruise and I don't think I'll be doing it again.

We absolutely love the cruise experience on this line. The demographic is dead right for us as we are about the youngest on the ship (late 60s early 70s). This cruise had several days at sea but we enjoy those and there were excellent talks, some not related to the cruise at all. One superb speaker was a coroner who discussed fascinating subjects such as Jack the Ripper and the origins of coroners. There were also representatives of an organisation studying whales who provided useful information about what to see or what had been seen. The crew were superb, the food first rate.

The ports visited were:•	Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia•	Nha Trang, Vietnam•	Phu My, Vietnam (90 min drive north to Saigon or 90 min south to Vung Tau)•	Sihanoukville, Cambodia•	Laem Chabang port, Thailand (90 min drive to Bangkok or 30 min to Pattaya)•	Ko Samui, Thailand•	Singapore (again – some passengers disembarked after an 11 night cruise)•	Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.There were 5 sea days.One notable thing about the route the ship took was that instead of sailing in a straight line between Kota Kinabalu and Nha Trang, we had to take a slight detour to the west in order to avoid the contested areas in the South China Sea around the Spratly Islands (western name) which the Chinese are building on (and which they call Nansha Qundao), with claims to the islands also being made by Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia.  It’s a pretty hot area right now for people who are interested in the international law of the sea, although you wouldn’t have known it on the peaceful blue day when we sailed past.What I likedSapphire Princess is an attractive ship.  The 3 deck atrium of the Piazza is impressive.  There are 5 (5!) swimming pools for passengers.  The large outdoor movie screen is a fun place to watch a movie.  There are lots of options for ‘anytime dining’ in the evening and only once in 14 days did I give up on the wait for a table and go to the buffet instead.  There are lots of bars to choose from for a drink.In the cabin the bed was very comfortable.  The TV screen was large and the definition was very sharp, just about life-like.  There were lots of new and recent movies available and the choice was added to most days.  The walk-in closet had lots of hangers.This was my first cruise as a Captain’s Circle platinum member.  That meant I got my first invitation to the ‘Captain’s Cocktail Party’ which was fun.  To my surprise they were actually serving cocktails and not cheap wine, and I got to meet the captain briefly and to chat at greater length with the first officer and his wife who were a lovely Croatian couple.  Being platinum also meant that each day between 4.30-6.30pm I was invited to the Skywalkers nightclub where they served slightly cheaper cocktails than elsewhere onboard, and there was a range of canapes and nibbles that changed each day.  It was a nice place to sit with a drink and watch the sunset before dinner.Other things I enjoyed were:•	the show Let Me Entertain You in the Princess Theatre;•	the backstage tour of the Princess Theatre;•	the food and service in the Sterling Steakhouse and Sabatini’s, the only places on the ship where I gave extra gratuities on top of what was added automatically to my account;•	participating in the Princess Pop Choir.  We sang Can’t Take My Eyes Off You, Blame It on the Boogie, Waterloo and our encore was Can You Hear the People Sing from Les Miserables.  My school choir master would have had a conniption but it was fun;•	that finally, many years behind the times, it was possible to get a diet soft drink other than Diet Coke onboard.  Sapphire Princess now has Sprite Zero, hooray;•	the portion sizes in the dining rooms, and the change in emphasis on the menus from a 4 course dinner (appetiser / soup / main course / dessert) to a 3 course dinner – although anyone who wanted 4 courses or more could ask for it;•	the speedy food service in the dining rooms;•	we were able to dock at Sihanoukville, despite having been told it would be a tender port;•	surprisingly, I didn’t usually have to wait very long for an elevator on this ship.Possibly useful informationThere are no kettles in passenger cabins.  They are only available on the cruises where Sapphire Princess is based in Southampton, UK.There are USB charging points in the bedside lamps, so I was able to charge my phone and my iPad without needing an adapter.  All the power points in the cabin are US-style.There is a passenger laundry on each deck where there are passenger cabins (except deck 14).  It costs $3 to use the washer, $3 to use the dryer and $1.50 for washing powder.  I had to use my cruise card to buy tokens from a dispensing machine in the laundry and then I had to insert tokens into the washing machine and dryer to use them.  The machines were fine, they didn’t shred or shrink my clothes.  I didn’t have to wait for a machine.  The washers and dryers had 40 minute cycles.  The pre-cruise information from Princess said that passport-style photos would be necessary to get visas or landing cards onboard for Vietnam and Cambodia.  No photos were needed.If you are doing a Princess shore excursion to any temples and the information says to ‘dress modestly’, take it seriously.  Wear long pants, and don’t wear anything sleeveless or low-cut.  I saw several other passengers get told they would not be allowed into sites because they were wearing shorts, cropped pants or skimpy tops – and that also applied to shorts and cropped pants that ended below the knee.It is not exaggerating to say that the whole of Sihanoukville is a building site.  The road paving has all been dug up and there are no sidewalks.  The traffic is horrendous.  I strongly recommend against any attempt to see Sihanoukville independently.  Either stay on the ship that day, or go on a Princess shore excursion where you have some hope of being looked after if things go pear-shaped ashore.If you like trivia, the onboard trivia is generally (not always) twice a day at about 10am and 4.30pm.If you like being active, you could spend most mornings doing tai chi at 8.30am, Zumba with the delightful Cesar from Colombia at 9.15am and then line-dancing with the lovely English rose Emma at 10.45am.  After lunch there was often another dance class with Emma for partner dances like the cha cha or rumba.The shows in the Princess Theatre each night were at 7.45pm and repeated at 9.45pm.  Sometimes in the evening there would be an activity like ‘Name That Tune’ or ‘Jeopardy’ at 7pm but not every day – often there was no organised activity after the afternoon trivia until about 8pm or 8.30pm.  There was an assortment of different music in different places onboard from about 5pm to about 8pm.  It was all laid-back music of different styles over that dinner period.  The up-tempo music would start at around 9.30pm.  I am not sure how late it went on.  I did not get the impression that there was a lot of late-night activity on this ship.Each day in the library they put out 2 different puzzles that you can take away and do.  They clearly haven’t revised the puzzles for years, but it was something for a quiet moment.What I didn’t likeI had a service issue with the purser’s desk about an unauthorised charge on my account for an unnecessary visa that took days to resolve.  It just took way too long to get fixed.  It first arose on day 3 of the cruise and it was not fixed properly until day 10.  I had to keep checking my account and go back to the desk 5 times, and at least twice I was given information that was just plain wrong.  The issue was eventually fixed to my satisfaction.  Thank you to Slavdana and Dee for that.  No thanks to some of their colleagues who I won’t name.  No thanks either to the internal Princess systems that led to a visa being issued in the wrong passport and then charging me for it although I didn’t even need that visa.I didn’t like the reams of paper that accumulated in my cabin advertising every conceivable onboard activity.  It became nearly impossible to keep track of what was important and what was junk.  It was an appalling waste of paper.I didn’t like that there were only 2 channels showing sport on the TV, and they were either showing Australian big bash cricket or US basketball and very little else (occasionally some soccer or golf).  I had expected to be able to watch the ATP Cup tennis and the Adelaide International tennis but no, there was no tennis on the TV until the Australian Open started.I didn’t like overhearing crew members talking amongst themselves and complaining about other crew members.  This happened several times and it was poor form for crew members to be talking like that within earshot of passengers.I didn’t like the stale smell in my cabin from years of airconditioning and machine-dried linen.  It was a window cabin not a balcony cabin, so unfortunately I couldn’t get any fresh air into the cabin.  When I got home I had to wash all the clothes I took with me because they still had that stale smell on them.I didn’t like having to pay $29 for dinner in the Sterling Steakhouse and at Sabatini’s, although I very much enjoyed the food and the service there.I didn’t like the way the fitness centre classes were run.  The free stretch classes at 7am and at 9.30am were a waste of time as the instructors only did the minimum that they could get away with and were far more interested in trying to sell something, whether it was a ‘class pass’ for other classes or a ‘footprint analysis’ for some sort of pseudo-medical quackery.  If you have painful feet or a sore back I strongly recommend you consult a health professional in your home town, not a Princess fitness instructor working for gratuities.  Yes, that’s right, the fitness instructors get 18% auto-gratuities.  I have no idea what the justification is for that, except possibly it’s because the fitness centre is located in the spa and when they’re not working the fitness centre and spa staff all chat together, so maybe in some twisted way it is perceived as ‘not fair’ if the spa staff get gratuities and the fitness instructors don’t.There are some fitness classes which are offered for $15 per class + 18% auto-gratuity.  They were yoga, pilates, spin and something called TRX which didn’t seem to mean cross-training as far as I could tell.  I wasn’t familiar with it, whatever it was.  The class timetable was inconsistent but the general pattern seemed to be that there would be classes at about 7.30am and 8.30am each day (hopeless on port days if you were going ashore, and an early start for a vacation day even if you were not going ashore) and another class at 5pm each day.  It varied which class was on at which time.  They never seemed to offer all 4 of the class types on the same day as far as I could see, only 2 or 3 out of the 4 class types each day.There was a lot of pressure to buy a ‘class pass’, either 3 classes for $39.95 + 18% auto-gratuity or unlimited classes for $99.95 + 18% auto-gratuity.  The trick with a class pass was that it was only for one sort of class.  So for example if you bought a yoga class pass, you could only use it for yoga classes and not for pilates classes.  Too bad if they didn’t have a yoga class every day, or if the yoga class was scheduled for a time that you were ashore or doing something else.  I was glad I didn’t buy a class pass because by the end of the cruise I had only done 1 yoga class (which I disliked) and 1 pilates class (which I liked, but I never found another pilates class at a time that suited me).  I disliked the yoga class because it was held in the fitness studio which was very cold and which had several treadmills in it that were noisy when people were using them.  The instructor said it was going to be a simple yoga class but it ended up including poses like dolphin pose, which is not a simple pose to me.  The ship movement made balancing much harder than on land.  After that class was over I didn’t feel at all relaxed or uplifted like I normally would after doing yoga on land.The spa employed the hard sell too.  When I booked one treatment, I was pressured to make it three.  When I booked a Swedish massage, I was pressured to make it a deep tissue massage ($25 more expensive + 18% auto-gratuity).  I hated the fact that the stated treatment prices, already ludicrously high, were in fact only about 85% of the eventual actual total price once the 18% auto-gratuity had been added.  I hated the fact that there was tacit pressure to add another gratuity on top of the 18% they had already automatically added.  I booked the ‘Fire and Ice’ pedicure, their so-called top of the range pedicure which cost an eye-watering $90.85, only to find that there was no drying machine for the nail polish and instead of a large array of colours of polish to choose from all lined up beautifully in the colours of the spectrum, there was a small black plastic tub with about 20 bottles of nail polish lying around on the bottom looking like they were rejects from a charity shop.  It did not feel like a premium experience at all, especially at the end when the pedicurist just said ‘sit here for about 15-20 minutes to let it dry’ and walked off – I never saw her again after that.The shops had similar hard-sell tactics.  Here is my conversation with a shop assistant onboard:Me: “I would like to buy these 2 items costing $80 please”.Her: “I can offer you a special discount.  If you buy 3 items I will only charge you $108 which is 10% off”.Me (thinking, if I was actually getting 10% off the things I really want to buy, the price would be $72): “Ok I will add this third other item that costs the same as the other 2”.Her: “No it has to be 3 items exactly the same, even though you only want 2 of them.  If you want to buy that third other item as well, the cost will be $120”.Me: “No thank you, I will stick to my original 2 items for $80”.  When I got back to my room and opened my packages I noticed that she had slipped a voucher in there which said that if I spent another $50, I would only be charged $45 (10% off).  I didn’t go back to the shops again after that.  I was fed up with the never-ending hard sell and the nickel and diming.Many afternoons I was bored.  Princess calls it ‘relaxing afternoon’ in the Princess Patter but I would call it ‘not enough interesting afternoon activities unless you want to go to some pseudo-lecture that is actually yet another cunningly disguised sales pitch to try to get you to spend even more money’.  Some evenings I was also bored after dinner if I didn’t want to go to the theatre show and there were no other activities until later.If I didn’t want to sit in my cabin, it was hard to find a pleasant place to sit and read on this ship.  Where many cruise ships have an observation lounge forward and high up, Sapphire Princess has a cluster of treadmills in the fitness centre and an under-utilised area called The Sanctuary which I never saw anybody in, presumably because people weren’t prepared to spend the necessary $20 to sit there for half a day ($40 for a full day).  There was a peaceful shaded area outside on deck 15 called The Conservatory but it was plagued by wafting sewerage smells which ruined it.  There were deck chairs in the shade outside on deck 7 but competition for them was fierce and not all of them had a view of the sea due to various items attached to the railings.  The deck chairs on decks 14 and 15 were mainly in the full sun.  Inside, there were few places to sit that weren’t food or beverage outlets, and usually they were packed and there was some noisy activity or other going on.  The Skywalkers Lounge had nice views during the day but it was directly under the basketball court and often there were loud thumping noises from above as people played basketball.  I was very glad I had not booked an inside cabin for this cruise because finding anywhere else peaceful to sit was hard.My cabin was near the so-called ‘Art Gallery’.  That meant I walked through the ‘Art Gallery’ several times a day.  Apart from forming the opinion that most of the ‘art’ was probably done on a 3D printer somewhere in China and not by a human using paintbrushes, I was entertained by the various labels that were affixed to the ‘art’.  There was one particular ‘painting’ that I noticed of a rainy New York street scene.  One day it had ‘sold’ affixed to it.  The next day it disappeared.  Then it (or a copy) was back, with ‘I’m interested’ affixed to it.  Then it went upstairs to the art auction.  When it came back down, it had no label on it.  I have no idea what was going on, but I definitely would not buy any of this ‘art’ under the illusion that it might be unique or collectable.  Sure, buy it if you like it and it’s going to suit your décor, but don’t fall for the onboard spin that it’s going to accrue in value.Disembarkation was not streamlined well.  The disembarkation instructions had no information about how passports would be returned to passengers.  My cabin steward knocked on my door at 6.25am on disembarkation day to return my passport, which was very irritating as I was still in bed and also irritating because when we had docked in Singapore after 11 nights, the arrangement for passports was to collect them personally at the internet café.  I don’t know why Princess did not explain in advance that there would be a different procedure on this occasion.  The ‘platinum and elite disembarkation lounge’ in Club Fusion was a mess, full of uncleared tables containing the unappetising remains of other people’s breakfasts while the only wait staff member hid behind the bar doing nothing.  Normally I’m happy with the way Princess organises disembarkations, but not this time.But the worst bit was definitely that I got sick twice on this cruise.  For the early part of the cruise I had a respiratory infection that went into my lungs and became bronchitis.  I developed a horrible cough and if I was lying on the bed watching TV I could literally feel mucus bubbling in my lungs as I breathed.  Just when I was almost over that, late on the last sea day of the cruise I had an attack of vomiting and diarrhoea.  I started to feel off about 4 hours after eating lunch in the buffet, and the attack started about another 4 hours after that.  Even after the symptoms stopped around midnight (luckily I hadn’t eaten a big lunch), I felt bad enough from dehydration next day that I missed the last port and stayed in my cabin that day resting.  Can I say for sure that it was anything onboard Sapphire Princess that made me sick?  No, I can’t say that for sure.  But I suspect that it was, and I heard stories about other people who had respiratory or stomach problems onboard, including one of the cruise activities staff who was telling everyone about having a sore throat.  Unfortunately when I think back about this cruise, one of my strongest memories is of feeling off-colour a lot of the time.  And sadly that memory and all the relentless nickel and diming onboard have me wondering whether I ever want to do another cruise.",Sail Date: January 2020|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: |Destination: Asia|,Australia

Originally, the cruise included Nagasaki and would have ended in Shanghai, but due to the Corona Virus, the company changed the final destination to Tokyo and removed Nagasaki.  To be fair, an epidemic is not the cruise line's fault, but it also is not our fault. The two major reasons for us to take this cruise are: 1) to allow my 87 year old father to visit his hometown of Shanghai. He left there in 1949, and he really wants to be reunited with his brothers and sister. He is 87, and each year that goes by, there is less of a chance to reunite with his family. 2) to fulfill my husband's dream of visiting Nagasaki, where the US dropped the atomic bomb. When Princess removed these two ports, we just wanted to get our deposit back, since this is no longer the cruise that we wanted to go on, but they refused. I feel in light of the fact that my parents have cruised with them 10 times in the past, and that I am also a Ruby member, they should have at least considered our loyalty.

The ship was good, the stateroom really lovely and with such a comfortable bed. However, the on board costs were extortionate. For example the cost of a bottle of wine, cheapest being $33 on wine menu, but $42 on our account, due to tax being added afterwards. Feel the charges were geared to the American passengers, but for all of us from the UK, far too expensive. Sundries in the little shop were double at home prices. When the ship couldn't come into port, there was a charge to be tendered ashore, $15 round trip. ATM charged nearly $8 per transaction. Photographs were $25 each. Most passengers were drinking water at dinner. Wouldn't it be wise to have affordable prices and more sales? Salon treatments were more than double P&O. We took an excursion to Cambodia, Sihoukville, $159.95 plus visa, $50 only to find it like a 'building site' with craters and only dirt roads, despite being a city. The air quality, red dust was really unhealthy and my husband has had a bad cough ever since. Despite being one of many who complained we have received no response to date. Why did they take us to this port and then how could they charge us for it?The food was good and the staff friendly, but the entertainment company shows were tired and the same as we had seen on this ship back in 2018.",Sail Date: January 2020|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Middle East|,"Falmouth, United Kingdom"

Facilities on the ship were excellent, great food, excellent service, spacious comfortable cabin and courteous, helpful and friendly staff. At the time of the cruise we were informed that in November 2019 this cruise ship would reposition from Southampton to Singapore and there were great deals available during this repositioning. So we signed up for a 27 day cruise joining the ship this time in Rome on its journey to the Far East. Once again everything on the ship was excellent, food, service, comfort, balcony cabin, excursions, entertainment etc. We visited a large number of ports including Naples, Santorini, Rhodes, transit through the Suez Canal, Aqaba in Jordan for Petra, Red Sea, an unscheduled stop in Jeddah emergency medical disembarkation. Then after Jeddah, followed a large number of days at sea before sailing through the Straits of Hormuz into the Gulf for Abu Dhabi and Dubai both of which are very interesting cities to visit. The voyage continued after leaving the UAE back through the Straits of Hormuz for Oman and the port of Muscat. Long days at sea again before arriving at Colombo in Sri Lanka which offers a complete contrast to the many other ports visited on the voyage. After Sri Lanka, a few more days at sea before arriving in Port Kelang Malaysia which offers great excursions from the ship to Kuala Lumpur. A day later arrived in Singapore where the cruise finished. Overall a great cruise and one to be highly recommended.

I have never been on a Princess ship like this one.  Positives - the cabin staff were great, helpful and attentive!  Areas of improvement - FOOD, rumor has it that the menu changes to the ""Asian"" market when it's in that market.  if these changes are the ones requested by that market, then were in tough shape.  The dining room ""Princess Classics"" Alfredo (like a frozen meal) the Princess strip steak was changed to a Princess burger, what?  The portions were tiny.  The ship someone calls her the True Lady of the Ocean, its more like the OLD LADY of the OCEANS.  If you take this trip, DO NOT get off in Cambodia, its a disaster.  Trust me!!  You will return to the ship ASAP!  The unfortunate thing about the way Princess arranges the ports and the excursions through princess, you wast a LOT of time on a bus!!!  My recommendation is to go to Viator and purchase a driver on your own.  We had a day in Bangkok, which after the drive to the city was 3 hours.  That's not enough time to see 1 palace.  Friends who hired a driver were there in 1.5 hours, had a full day and got back to the ship before us.  The entertainment, the comic was booed off the stage... literally booed off.

We genuinely never had a bad meal and there was enough choice to make us all happy.Our only complaint, was that we had two tender ports (Phuket & Bali) and the organisation of the tenders was terrible. It took so much time to take everyone off the ship. We took our tender tickets at 8am (when they told us too) and it still took 1 hour 30 mins to get on the tender boat.

In the Princess feedback process I have strongly criticised, for example, the fact that one did not include the promised visits to two highlight venues but the tour guide made sure we had over 30 minutes in a gift shop ; on another the guide regarded himself as something of an actor with the resultant quotations but very little local information ; the Reversing Falls turned out to be a large pool as the river / tidal occurrence only occurs for a short space of time so most excursion parties missed it.Boston was a nightmare - 90 minutes in a queue to disembark as, seemingly, the Captain and crew totally misread the terminal gangway procedures.The theatre has around 1,000 seats so with 2400 passengers and two showings each evening you either had to be there at least 30 minutes before the start or walk away. We have completed around 20 cruises and compared with Celebrity, for example, and the latter has much better food and suite guests are recognised with, for example, separate lounge and dining rooms, reserved seating in the theatre, and better priority excursion transport.Our overall 4 stars reflects the fact that we did were determined to enjoy what was an expensive cruise booked as we both have significant birthdays this year.

Sapphire Princess had the best cruise director and staff ever.  we enjoyed the various game shows and particularly the ones which Paul, the cruise director was involved.  his quick wit and humor were most enjoyable and made us forget the disappointment of not really seeing the Northern Lights.  the evening lounge shows were always packed and hard to find seating.  the 8 o'clock Princess theater shows were also packed and a challenge to find seating after the 5:45 pm meal that ended usually after 7:30pm.  Sapphire Princess could have shifted lounge shows from the Explorers Lounge to a larger lounge such as Fusion since they were so popular, but that adjustment never happened so we missed a few shows because we can't get seating.  the cruise activity staff was very enthusiastic and upbeat.  the assistant cruise director Martin was also very funny and had a ""large"" personality.food staff was very attentive despite mundane food.  main dining room staff was very good and our family enjoyed their service very much.  they were always smiling and offered good suggestions regarding menu selections.stater room stewards received mixed reviews.  while other family members had a good steward, we had only a so-so steward that seemed to only do the minimum and had to be asked multiple times to provide more hand lotion (which was needed since Princess instituted a diligent hand washing requirement in Horizon Court for buffet dining).  Sapphire Princess also did not provide advance information regarding local transportation to allow us to plan properly any independent sight seeing.  Princess gave us a feel that the withholding/lack of information was deliberate so that they can promote their own excursions.  we feel that they also used the guise of tender planning and coordination to gain knowledge about the competing local tours and companies.in summary, Sapphire Princess did a good job in navigating to ports and had a very smooth disembarkation, best one so far for us with Princess.  we can recommend this ship and its staff as long as there are no high expectations regarding the seeing Northern Lights as the goal for this cruise.",Sail Date: October 2019|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: |Destination: Europe|,

Each of the cities we stopped at had a definite charm, and even though we had some gray and rain when at sea, we were fortunate enough to have wonderful weather at each of the port cities.  In Alta, however, being the furthest North, on our first day we had snow, and it was beautiful.  Both my wife and I loved the snow, as it reminded us both of our youth. Unfortunately, on the first night in Alta, the snow made it impossible to view the Northern Lights.

When brought to their attention we were told that things would improve, but they didn’t, the manager told us that they would be in touch after a couple of days to see if things had improved. They did not get back to us and things didn’t improve.The waiters / waitresses were excellent as were the bar staff and cabin stewards.However this does not make up for some of the arrogance and sarcastic attitude of other members of staff in particular the future cruise sales representative.It also seemed to my wife and I that there had been some collusion between the Princess Cruise Line and an on shore tour company called Greyline Halifax to fix the price of An hop off hop on bus tour. This came to our attention when we attempted to purchase tickets on a hop on hop tour in Halifax Nova Scotia after we had disembarked from our ship we were required to purchase our tickets by using our on board cruise card, there was also other cruise ships in port and We wondered if they were also involved in this?

We boarded in Southampton which is good for us as we are only 45 minutes away by road. We choose to go with Princess this time as they had an additional port of call compared to P&O so we thought it would be worth the additional cost. The ship is getting old but still has all you could need as an adult cruiser not sure about the children's clubs as there were not many children on board we never saw any activities for them. The crew were wonderful attentive and friendly, always smiling and willing to do all they could to ensure you were happy. The down side of Princess is that they charge for everything in US$ and their prices are high for example water bought on line before you go; 12 pack of 500ml worked out about 50p a bottle on board the same size was 2dollars. We felt that they charged too much and for items were were used to getting for free on other lines such as shuttle buses in the ports. The port trips were well organised and run smoothly even if costly almost double the actual cost when undertaken independently, still they are a business and their purpose is to make money. The evening entertainment ranged from excellent to poor so very hit and miss. The food in all restraints we used on board was really good and portion size was good too. It was nice that most people did dress for the formal nights although some did not. The age ranged was carried and cruisers were from the UK, USA, Australia and a few from Europe. Would we travel with them again - Yes but would look to see if P&O were undertaking the same route first as they would be our first choice.

I will explain vv briefly rather than prattle on and whine!Staffing: I noticed that there seemed to be less staff particularly in bars and restaurants than previously - perhaps this affected the following points but seeing uncleared tables in bar areas (my usual gripe is that staff hover nearby to take your glass and push bar sales... now we have the other extreme!) and waiting sat at a restaurant table for someone to give a menu is just the tip of the iceberg..Decor and fittings: sailed with this ship last year and its deteriorated significantly since then - public areas and cabins.. my cabin had a badly stained carpet - god knows what was there but come on Princess, i am paying over 2k each and expect better than this, at least clean it or remove it!Spa: just give up on this Princess... way over priced, staff not listening to what you are asking for and arguing over who is going to deal with you when you finally get the message across is not selling the dream!Speciality dining: is it really ‘speciality’? Sabatini’s italian restaurant was mediocre service but not a bad menu but thanks for butchering my lobster while extracting it from its shell... the local fire service could do a cleaner job with the jaws of life! Certainly not worth the cover charge.. Sterling Steakhouse was good but not a ‘speciality’. Service not withstanding i would use the main restaurants and save my money to enhance that experience.Shore excursions: way overpriced, source independent excursions before you go and you will see what i mean. $99ea for a 1 hour coach ride to Florence with Princess, 35 euro for the same ride arranged ourselves.. enough said!There were some great experiences so it wasn't all bad - pizzeria was nice, cabin steward was superb, staff in general were great but short on the ground, shows were good, ‘The Retreat’ was worth the cover charge...In summary i am trying another company and giving up significant loyalty benefits in the process (Elite status with mil benefits is quite a bonus) just shows how dissatisfied i was with the trip and while i have fed back to Princess, its better to vote with my feet and spend my hard earned cash elsewhere!

I should also point out that we are by no means on a budget, but we are also no frivolous. I like to know that I am getting value for money, and that I am in control of what we spend.The boarding experience at Southampton could not have ran smoother. We had our photos taken and cards scanned as we boarded, and then spent the next few hours exploring the ship. If you have children who will be using the kids club services (ours were 9 and 14) then I recommend visiting this deck first (15 aft) because here you can sign you children up (if you haven’t already done so online) and you will get the chance to put their name down for the young chefs experience for a small fee (I think $25) where they will get chance to spend some time in the kitchens decorating a cake, but there are a limited number of spaces for this **Our room**We had a mini suite with a balcony on Deck 9 right outside the rear lifts. The room was amazing, the large main bed was comfortable, and the kids slept on a sofa bed and a bunk bed which pulled down from the ceiling. There were two flat screen televisions in the room showing a number of the latest movies and box sets. The bathroom even had a bath! The balcony was basic, but did the job and proved to be a god send when it came to drying some of the clothes we decided to wash through that we did not want to tumble dry. Just on that for a second – there is a ban on using your own ironing facilities on the room (for good reason) but on every deck alternating front and aft there are laundry rooms with fixed ironing boards and irons, and washing machines and tumble driers (4 boards, 7 washer dryer units). Accessing our nearest one means descending the stairs that were right outside our room and walking about 50 yards along the corridor. Our room was tidied by Carlo as long as he could gain access to it by 13:00 (sometimes we were in there every time he tried) and then the beds were turned down in the evening. Room service is available to your room, we tried to use it 8 times, and after usually waiting on hold for 15 mins we were successful in ordering a basic breakfast twice. This service needs an overhaul because it really doesn’t work very well at all. **Payments**Before we get onto the thorny subject of gratuities I should mention that there is never any money that changes hands while on board. Your cruise card is used to pay for everything. It’s also quite rare to be asked to sign for anything, something you may be used to in other hotels. The staff member will simply take your card from you, swipe it, and give it back. For this reason, its not always entirely clear what is being charged to your account unless you keep an eye on it. To do this you can either a) register and login to the ships web site, b) access your account details from an electronic terminal situated next to reception or c) ask a member of reception to print it for you. Personally – I would recommend my way, which was to sign up for a Monzo card and register this as the card attached to stateroom account. That way whenever there was a charge to it I would be notified. Its also worth noting that your card is charged (or an amount held on it) every evening, which I quite liked but which is different from other cruises I have been on where the accounts are normally cleared at the end of the holiday.So, Gratuities….. Firstly – YES, the staff do a great job. They deserve to be paid. But, we Brits are simply not used to the tipping way of life and everyone who we spoke to felt the same. Princess will, by default, charge gratuities daily to your account, which for us was at a rate of $15.50 per person (including the children), a total of $62 per day (over £700 for the holiday). Also, “tips” do not stop their either because every drink you order at a bar will have 18% added to it, and everything you have from the fitness centre and spa will have 15% added to it. Sometimes, depending on which port you are in you may also find that additional local taxes are added to your drinks bill (in span for instance the total added to the advertised price of a drink was 28%).For me, I think this is wrong. Tips in the UK have always been about rewarding good service (and NO, the service was not always great on this cruise – I wouldn’t expect it to be, these people are not robots after all) so by reducing gratuities to a regular, fixed charge they have in effect turned them into a salary for those on board removing the incentive to provide great service. Que those who will say things like – “well yeah, but what about the people you don’t see, the people who clean the towels, or keep the ship looking nice” and to that I say they should be paid a salary. They are not “fount of house” staff, they are not interacting directly with the guests, and they should therefore not need the incentive to go the extra mile through tipping. In truth, This is a mechanism to get additional revenue from guests that can be knocked off the advertised price of the cruise to make those cruises more competitive on the holiday company web sites.  I reckon most “Brits” will probably end up googling whether they are mandatory, and you will find all sorts of posts in forums that make you feel like scum for even contemplating having them removed. Some posts will even suggest that you should inspect a Spanish inquisition style interrogation from the reception staff if that’s what you try to do, but believe me when I tell you this, that’s all BS. On day two, we went to reception expecting a fight (because we read those forums) and the entire exchange could not have been more pleasant. It went something like this, “hello, can we have auto-gratuities removed from our account, we prefer to tip as we go”, “yes sir, that’s a really good option, just one moment and Ill get that sorted for you right away”, “done, is there anything else I can do for you?”. Done.We certainly were not alone either, we spoke to 10 people, all Brits, all of which had done the same. Want proof that Auto-Gratuities are not aligned with the British culture, look at P&O. they scrapped them in March and decided they would simply pay their staff instead. Bravo to them.There is nothing you can do about the 18% on drinks and 15% on fitness though, but you know what – I don’t mind that so much because presumably those gratuities go to the bar staff and fitness instructors and they ARE front of house workers that deserve them. My main negative really is that, although it was difficult to explain, compared to other cruises myself and my wife have been on with princess we just got this feeling that they were penny pinching – trying to make money from us at every opportunity. Nothing demonstrates this quite as much as the cost of excursions, which is a real shame because I will go out on a limb here and say – for a FACT – that passengers missed out exploring the wonderful placed we visited because the costs of the excursions were ridiculous. For example:In Marseilles, we got an Uber taxi to transfer us to the local town for ¼ of the cost of the coach transfer the ship offered (a journey time of 10 minutes) When arriving in Italy for the first time most people will either want to visit Piza, or Florence but we simply were not willing to pay for the excursion into either of these places because the bill would have been in excess of £400. Instead we paid no more than 40 to transfer into the local town where there were local tourist agents advertising THE SAME TRANSFERS for 15 Euro per passenger!And, thank god we found them, because this got us thinking again about what we would have done in Rome. On the ship the Rome excursion which essentially took in the Colosseum and other local attractions I had worked out to be over 200 Euro per person. So again, we go a local transfer from the dock into the local town, where sure enough there were tourist agents holding boards for every flavour of tour you could imagine. In fact, when we got speaking to one of them they told us that they were the tour company used by the cruise company, and that the tour guides were the same. The total price of a tour around the Vatican, Colosseum (although we didn’t go inside), Trevi fountain and other attractions cost a little over 100 Euro. We also found that the excursions offered by Princess were a little “samey”. Very history focused, and not many options at all for those with children. For instance it would have been nice to perhaps see trips to a local water park on offer, but to be honest, after our experience over the price of these trips I think you would be mad to book any. Do your research, find a way to transfer to the local town (usually this a service arranged by the cruise company), and put your faith in the fact that when you pull up in those towns, the locals will be there waiting for you offering far more than Princess do, and for a fraction of the price. **Drinks Package** We are not big drinkers, we drink a bottle of wine a day between us, and then during the day we would have around 2-3 cocktails and maybe a beer. Our total ship account bill after 2 weeks was $1400, and this included a rather expensive trip to the spa ($240), quite a few coffees, and about $100 of internet access. For the family to have had a full drinks package would have cost us $1800 so by my reckoning we would have had to have drank over double what we were drinking to have even broken even. I really can’t imagine doing this, there are those that would, some of my friends would prop the bar up most of the day, but I refuse to believe that 50% of the ship breaks even on the drinks package, which means it really is not work having unless you are big drinkers. We did however have a 10 bottle wine package which we purchased on-board on day 2. Neither of us remember seeing this before boarding, and it saved us around $5-$10 per bottle over 10 bottles, which was just about perfect for us. If you buy this package you will be issued with a card which is punched every time you order a bottle (up to $45 – which is pretty much all of them). If you don’t finish the bottle, the restaurant you are in at the time simply holds onto it, and a waiter will go and retrieve it for you wherever you are the next time you want to carry on drinking it. **The Restaurants**We had anytime dining, which basically meant that we had to make our own arrangements for dinner. It also meant that there were two restaurants we could not access for our evening meal. Our food and service on our first evening was dreadful. Three courses of food that I think I could have prepared myself served, eaten in less than 25 minutes. Fortunately, I am pleased to say that although this was not an isolated incident on the first night it was in no way a reflection of the rest of the meal during the holiday – so we put it down to the difficulties of sitting everyone down on that first night. What was disappointing is that among the three restaurants we could eat in with no additional charge, all had the same menu each night. This means that if you are fussy eaters (and if you are you may struggle some nights) don’t think that because there are three restaurants that there are three menus to choose from. It was our wedding anniversary and my wife’s birthday while on board, and to celebrate we decided to pay and eat in the Italian restaurant, but unfortunately the food and service were decidedly average. Towards the end of the holiday we also paid and ate in the steak house, and although the fillet mignon was to die for, most evenings you had the option of paying and eating of its menu in one of the other restaurants (the Savoy I think).  If you like crab then there is also a crab shack restaurant available for an additional charge, but don’t go looking for them during the day because you won’t find them, they simply convert an area of the buffet restaurant and re purpose it as the steak house of crab shack in the evening. On the promenade deck there is also a Pizza restaurant tucked away in the corner, which is amazing. On the whole the food was excellent. Even the buffet was good. Curry lovers will like the fact that there is a curry station available every day, and although breakfast can get a little repetitive you can always access eggs, waffles, pancakes, bacon (American and English), sausages etc etc etc. In fact, the food available in the afternoons is amazing.My only criticisms would be that if you want an omelette you have to order them, and it would have been nice to see them take advantage of the local foods available in each port and offer meals from each of those countries. Also, and this really is being a bit picky, but, on the Rome day (when I think it is pretty obvious that people will be returning to the ship later than normal) the restaurants could have done with staying open a little longer. It was the one and only time we felt that we were not able to access food except for puddings in the international café on the Promenade (on the ground floor of the promenade there is a coffee station where you can pay for coffee and a small café which is always serving sandwiches, small salads, soup and cakes).I would also recommend taking breakfast in the international dining room where you order from a menu.With the odd exception everything is served in, or on plastic, which is quite practical, but still does not really, well you know…. Formal nights are really nice too. Not a single person who thinks “dressing up” means wearing an away shirt and their best trainers.**The entertainment**There are two bands, one that mainly does pop covers throughout the day in either one of the bar areas or in the main swimming pool area. The other plays the shows and I have to say they are brilliant. Some of the shows really did not appeal to our age group – but you cant please everyone, but all were professional and very entertaining. **Kids club** Our children could not get enough of kids club. Especially our 8 year old who practically begged us to let him attend every session. Our 14 year old made friends on the first day although at times I would have been happier if the staff were to have exerted a little more control over them because at times they decided they would prefer to “hang around” the stairwells where myself and my wife were worried they were being rowdy and causing a nuisance to other guests.Except for that, I can’t praise the staff and these facilities highly enough.**The Gym and Spa**I am a regular gym goer, more so when I am eating and drinking my own body weight in food and wine every day do the gym is important to me. I am pleased to say it one of the best I have been to of any cruise ship or hotel. They are missing no equipment that I can think of, and it was very unusual for it to be too busy (Personally I would have liked to have seen more than just 1 weights bench). They also run regular Spin, and TRX classes, as well as seminars on posture, feet and weigh loss. The classes are $15 each, but you can buy a pass for $100 (plus 15%) which means you can attend as many as you want for no additional fee. This only really works out to be cost effective though if you are going to attend 6 or more and that would be difficult to do because imho you will only use them on see days (I did all 6 spin classes) and still didn’t break even. They could do with linking the exercise pass to the cabin, rather than the person. That way myself and my wife would have likely used it and gotten our money’s worth. I also had a deep tissue Bamboo massage which was heavenly (although it did work out to be nearly £240). Be prepared for your therapist to try to dell you additional treatments and spa products at the end though. **Activities**The list of ship board activities are published and distributed to your room each day for the following day. The list of activities are endless, and I was impressed to see that they encourage gatherings of like-minded people at certain times and places throughout the cruise, like singles, ex-service men, LGBT etc. Although none of these applied to us, I can imagine how they would make it really easy to meet new friends very early on in the cruise for anyone who they did apply to. We are always fascinated about the scale of the behind the scenes operation. Things like how the kitchens work, how much food do they get through etc and I would have preferred to see some “behind the scenes” tours of the ship on offer. It would have been nice for the boys to have visited the bridge for instance.There is a big “art” presence on the ship which I found a little weird (again you can’t please everyone). A whole section of the forward promenade has been turned into an art gallery, and works are regularly auctioned off in organised events.There are two family and 1 adult pool at the rear of the ship, but I think they are heated because they are far too warm. Then there are two pools (one indoor!) in the middle of the ship, and another adult only pool at the front. It was quite rare not to be able to get a sun lounger, and very few were being overly reserved by people. There is no poolside drinks service which would have been a nice touch, so if you want a drink you are going to have to go get one.**Destinations**After Cadis the destinations come thick and fast, almost too fast. Personally, if it were me creating the itinerary I would have been tempted to replace Cadis with something a little further north that could have been accessed after only a day at sea (north Portugal perhaps). Marseille was also a nice surprise, and of course Piza and Rome are beautiful. Sardinia was disappointing, and Coueta a waste of time, that I would have replaced with a visit to Gibraltar instead. That said, there was never a sense that we needed longer in port and never any issue (except for the expense mentioned earlier) in accessing the local towns. **In summary**Wonderful ship, Wonderful staff, and great destinations. At times you get the sense that Princess are “Catch Pennies”, looking to profit from you in any way they can, but with the exception of the tax applied to drinks and use of the fitness centre you can largely avoid these additional charges if you want to. The price of the Excursions is shamefully inflated though and could so easily have altered our experience for the worse if we had not been confident in our ability to explore the destinations ourselves. More could be done to look after the younger people, not in the kids clubs – they are amazing – but elsewhere on the ship in the on-board activities and onshore excursions. Personally I found their “app” to be largely useless, as it isn’t an app at all but instead a web site. There is a messaging facility on there that enables you to keep in touch with other members of your family for free, but in reality it doesn’t work because being a web site there is no way for it to alert you to when you receive a message so you have to continually check. The fix is simple Princess, have an app written, then it could be great.My recommendations – do you research of the destinations, have faith that when you get to the local town you will have access to all of the same excursions you can pay for onboard, use a Monzo card on your account to track your spending, Cancel your auto gratuities and tip as you go for good service, and sign your kids up for the kids club even if you don’t normally. Also, Buy the 10-12 bottle wine package on board – that really is worth it, Get to the theatre 15 minutes before the show starts to get a seat, try the pizza restaurant, have a fillet mignon in the Savoy and have a great holiday. I went on a Thompson cruise once and felt like I had fallen into an 18-30’s holiday where I spend most of the 10 days praying for a U-Boat to put me out of my misery. This was absolutely nothing like that.Bon voyage!",Sail Date: August 2019|Cabin Type: Suite|Type of Trip: |Destination: Mediterranean|,"Bruch b Wittlich, Germany"

The ship uses dollars on board and it is not one of the cheapest for drinks. Entertainment was excellent. Tips on board are 14.50 usd per person per day which adds up very quickly but you can adjust at reception, note all drinks also carry a service charge. Tendering in Spanish morocco was a nightmare - queue to get back on board was very long and not very well managed on a very hot day. Overall we would travel with Princess again and you can transfer your P &O points which put us in Platinum class giving us early first boarding - big plus!!! Well worth a cruise if you haven't been with Princess before",Sail Date: August 2019|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: |Destination: Mediterranean|,

Food was plentiful, varied and good quality. First 4 days we ate mainly in the buffet area but tried the Savoy and Vivaldi restaurants and always ate dinner there for the rest of the cruise. Excellent food, on proper plates (not plastic) and very good service. Would advise to always use the restaurants for evening meals. Stuck to the buffet area for breakfasts as the choice was very wide. Drinks weren't cheap but the service in the bars was good and the drinks were nice. Bought a coffee package on the 4th day, would advise to buy it on day one, if you like coffees etc, in order to get full value from it.The cabins are sufficient size with a bed, a shower & toilet, a chair and desk area and plenty of mirrors. There is only one electrical outlet, I could find. and it is American style. Took an adaptor and a power strip that allowed us to charge phones and watches etc. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were excellent. The nice man who cleaned the room etc made a superb job every day.Smoking area are restricted to an area on one side of the bar, on the top deck, the stern area of the starboard deck on deck 7 and the Churchill Bar. Smoking is not permitted on any of the sunbathing areas. You are not allowed to smoke in the cabins, though you can vape. The cabin has a large screen TV that showed about 6 live channels (including news and sports, we watched some of the US Open) and also content on demand that has a lot of recent movies available (watched Aquaman for instance).The cruise we were on had a ""gratuities package"" that cost $29 per day each, which adds up to over $800 dollars for the 2 weeks. Found out you can opt out of this, by asking at the Customer Services desk, so gave tips at the end and saved ourselves a lot of money.Internet access is expensive at $100 for 100 minutes (about 7 minutes a day) but used our phones whilst in each port so had sufficient access and it was free whilst in Europe.All in all a pleasant 2 weeks and we would go back on this ship again",Sail Date: August 2019|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: |Destination: Mediterranean|,"Leeds, United Kingdom"

Non of this can be attributed to the cruise line and they did the right thing in evacuating the terminal. Chaos ensued as the terminal re-opened for business  with everybody arriving at the same time for check in. We had booked a suite for this trip and we were looking forward to some of the advantages that go with a suite cabin grade expediated dining etc. On the first night we dined at the much lauded STERLING STEAKHOUSE and i must say that my New York strip was quite tasty, the wife however was not impressed with the so called Fillet steak that she was presented with. A prime cut of meat you might think, no such luck it was as tough as old boots. The waiter was asked for his opinion and his stunning reply was that a steak knife might help overcome the problem. Needless to say we left unimpressed after politely declining their offer of a new piece of latex. The following evening we chose to dine in our allocated dining area, hopes were high as we ordered  our wine and settled down to our anticipated culinary delights. I ordered pasta ( you cannot cock that up can you) the wife again ordered  a meat course, Veal this time (a lovely tender piece of meat) or so you would think, wrong again you could not cut it. I invited the waiting staff to take this  abomination back to the chef so he could give us his comments. The Maitre D promptly arrived at the table offering a grovelling apology, after listening to his pathetic excuses we informed him that 1st impressions count never mind 2 night on the trot at the start of a cruise. We dined the rest of the week in the Horizon Court buffet and i must say that the food was of a very good standard.

The boat was clean and tidy with friendly helpful staff. The selection of bars and entertainment was also good (we had Gareth Gates on ours) with a good variety for all tastes, from comedy to jugglers to musicians and more - a good choice. The food was very good and again a good selection throughout the ship with the only criticism being it never came hot, only warm most of the time but never really hot, the casino was possibly too big and personally I didn’t like the choice of poker but we can’t please everyone. I would certainly consider going again with Princess but ……. there are always ‘but’s’ The first one is the drinks packages? Why can’t you have a drinks package by room? I personally believe it is a money making exercise but Princess really need to take their customers into consideration. If both people in a party bought what I believe is the basic drinks package you would be allowed up to 30 x $15 drinks per day – far too many.The thing is because that is too much couples buy one between them and so only one pays for a drinks package and so only one should use it, you can’t buy drinks for your partner but there are ways to circumvent the rules. You buy a drink in one bar and pop to the next to buy a drink for your partner. You simply wait ten minutes between ordering or you simply find a member of staff that doesn’t care. So Princess cut out the rubbish please and have drinks packages by room that suits couples who like to drink moderately throughout the day say 12-16 drinks per couple or in fact as many as people want, it’s not rocket science but it’s not good customer services either the way things are. Thomson’s do it by room why can’t you?I was going to say this is closely followed by the price of the drinks themselves, but maybe I should have put this top of the ‘buts’ list and whilst everyone is entitled to make money should we really be paying $9 for a medium sauvignon, $12 for the same sized merlot, $7 for a bottle of Budweiser or similar, and how about $41.50 for a basic bottle of that sauvignon? All far, far too much and whilst you have a captive audience you need to stop ripping off the customers who have spent a lot of money on a holiday with you in the first place, whilst it’s a cut in your profits, cut your drinks prices please and stop being so greedy and ripping us off, it is a kick in the teeth for sure!The cost of drinks is closely followed by the price for excursions. Whatever you are doing spend some time on Google before you go researching your destinations and trips. I won’t go into details but one excursion that would have cost us $139 per person on board cost us pretty much the same for two people simply by researching online and waiting until we went ashore. Sure for more money you get peace of mind but it’s all quite easy once you are there, remember the locals want to make money as well!! We didn’t book one trip through the cruise line and had a great time doing all sorts going many places!! And finally with the rip-off costs is the Wi-Fi – really you don’t even pay for Wi-Fi in McDonalds these days never mind any hotel you stay in so why do you pay what I once again call extortionate rates on a boat when you have already paid nearly £2,000 on a holiday - you don’t pay for Wi-Fi when you pay £3.99 for a McFlurry?? But then where else can you get Wi-Fi in the middle of the North Sea? Once again a massive money making exercise taking advantage of those who have already forked out a lot of money on a holiday! Pay as you go Wi-Fi is nearly $1 per minute and it soon adds up, another rip off and another kick in the teeth!Why have signs up around the swimming pools that say ‘no jumping or diving. And ‘running is prohibited’ only to let people (usually kids) do it? Either take the signs down or control it please. There is nothing worse than trying to relax around a pool to have people doing the afore mentioned when they shouldn’t. It invariably leads to more noise and your staff chose to ignore it or are scared or are not trained to deal with the situation. Don’t shy away from your rules – you made them!! You also need to keep your eye on younger children being bought alcoholic drinks.It will sound strange after writing this that I would actually go back on a Princess cruise, mainly because we can afford it, even with the rip off prices, but especially now I know what I know. Even when we were at sea the ship wasn’t overly busy, yes there were queues occasionally but when isn’t there these days?

The overall organisation of boarding, disembarking and going on shore excursions was the most efficient we've ever had. The entertainment in the theatre and the lounges was varied and all the entertainers were excellent. The cabin was a little small - we had only one chair to sit on, but it was kept immaculately clean by our friendly steward. All the staff were friendly, welcoming and efficient. The drinks package was hugely expensive (£773 per person) as were the shore excursions. We found the food to be disappointing - often the meat in stews or curries was so gristly that it was inedible. We thought the internet package was good value until we found that because of the ship's location it wasn't available on three or four days. This turned out to be the most expensive cruise out of the seven we've been on with various companies.",Sail Date: June 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Europe|,

There are many children, elderly and retirees on this very crowded ship so the pools and hot tubs are crowded with children. The Oasis area hot tub on the Sports deck is reserved for adults but did not bubble due to broken controls.  There also was no bartender at the bar so passengers had to leave the hot tub to travel down stairs to fetch drinks themselves from the lower level bar.  Reservations for the Chef's Table and Crabshack Restaurants can't be made on line in advance of the cruise.  This causes a mad dash upon boarding to ensure you are on the dining lists.  While the Platinum Studio on the Sports deck is wonderful, they diminish the relaxing effects when they hit the customer with a high pressure sales pitch at the end of an expensive massage trying to up-sale and reschedule subsequent visits.  Clothes shopping options for passengers are very limited.  Being on a cruise ship for days at a time with no moderate shopping venue is extremely difficult.  I personally spent over $2,000.00 buying clothing from the only women's shop on the ship in order to get through days before landing in a port since British Air lost my luggage. There are no shops catering to the average income shopper other than Calypso Cove on the Promenade deck.  The clothing options there are mostly cruise branded and male oriented.  The food services are overall good! Horizon Court cafeterias on the Lido deck have diverse and healthy food choices but are often over-crowded and it is difficult to find seating.  If you want a hot peaceful meal without walking the floors waiting for someone to vacate a table, use the dining rooms!  They are wonderful, not crowded and have excellent service!  Sabatini's Italian Restaurant on the Promenade deck is a ""must do"".  Excellent food and excellent service! The decor of the rooms is old and very basic but are clean and comfortable with VERY comfortable beds!  The door on the refrigerator cabinet in my room hung by one hinge. The water pressure in my shower was perfect.  The television in my room failed to operate twice.  The first time, a maintenance tech arrived promptly (within the hour) and corrected the problem.  The second time, it was more than two hours.  When I gave up on the technician after two follow up calls to the front desk, I mimicked what I had seen the previous tech do and successfully rebooted the TV myself.  The Promenade deck hosts a very popular venue, the Explorers Lounge.  The lounge is too small to hold the number of people who want to participate in the trivia and other games and shows that take place there.  I heard several passengers complaining that they weren't able to obtain seating, as we also experienced, and the standing room was outside the venue. In the end, if you can obtain a good price, this is a good cruise for a family with small kids or elderly.  The staff is always friendly and helpful!  However, If you are looking for something more upscale and less crowded, I would look for another ship.",Sail Date: April 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Europe|,"Orlando, United States"

The library is very small with may be only 200 books, nowhere near enough to be worth perusing.Due to low attendance, there was no wait for dining with all 3 meals,  pretty much just walk in every time. Food was OK.  The lobster was tasteless and NY steak tough and chewy.The itinerary was long and boring.  The cruise started out taking 2 days and 2 nights cruising from Singapore to Bali then wasted all morning at Bali for tenders.  We had only 4 hours in Bali before having to return to ship.In Kuala Lumpur the ship docked in Port Klang, a new port about 30 miles south  of the capital. Port Klang was a Chinese-built port with no business, a ghost town with hundreds of vacant, crumbling building blocks, with nothing to do or to see.  We had to take a long taxi ride to Kuala Lumpur.Had a long and boring cruise while Princess pushed its casinos, auctions of printed arts and various services onboard.  Airfares in Asia are now very cheap. I could have booked airfares, local transport, hotels and food for 2 people much cheaper and have more time to spend at every location, meeting local people, eating exciting local food and seeing local entertainment.Princess also charged 2 people with $860 on board charges without detailed explananation.  Waiting to resolve this issue.It is definitely better, cheaper and more fun to go on line and book airfares, hotels and use UBER/LYFT/GRAB/DIDI for local transportation.  You would have much better experiences with places of travels than getting stuck on an expensive ship for long strteches of cruis ewith nothing to do.",Sail Date: February 2019|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Asia|,

Because the main idea was to spend time with family, I wasn't worried by the number of ports that we missed because of the current (Mar 2020) pandemic.  We only got to two of the planned six ports but this was no fault of the crew, who tried very hard under very difficult conditions. The crew did a great job of making me feel welcome and keeping the cabin tidy.  I suspect the passengers/guests on Royal Caribbean Cruises tend to be a little younger, as the volume in the entertainment (shows, dance, anything with music) was very loud most of the time.  It would have been nice to have more variation in volume, but  I used ear protection and enjoyed the shows as much as the younger folk.  Definitely take ear protection! Our cabin was great, except for this: we were just opposite an open door to the lifts, so there was constant traffic, virtually 24/7, which made sleeping difficult. If you can sleep through anything, no problems, otherwise I suspect a cabin as far as possible from high traffic areas might be more pleasant.  The library was great at first, with a very useful large desk, but one or two other guests put a huge jigsaw on it for a number of days, preventing other people from using the desk.The ship is brilliantly lit at night, so I found the stars were hard to see through the reflected glare.  A pity - few of us get to see the stars these days!Overall, very enjoyable, although some minor annoyances!",Sail Date: March 2020|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: South Pacific|,"Hobart, Australia"

On this occasion though, on this particular ship and this particular sailing, the ship seemed overly crowded almost everywhere we went, causing us to not visit many of the venues that we would have liked to; and that's the reason for the first non-five rating I've ever given to Royal Caribbean. That having been said though, the crew were all excellent as they always are, and that's the really stand-out point with Royal Caribbean.This cruise also departed shortly after the start of the coronavirus alerts, resulting in more than half the ports we were scheduled to call at closing their borders to cruise ships. Royal Caribbean did their best though to organise alternate ports of call for us, and of course the decision that any of these South Pacific islands make in relation to the protection of their citizens from a threat such as this must be respected.

I wish I hadn't.Firstly, the good news; our room (1388) was terrific - large, tidy and with the promised ""spacious"" balcony; and the staff are generally delightful - enthusiastic and helpful. My main complaint was that the food was awful in most of the dining locations. We ate in the Dining Room, the Windjammer buffet (over-crowded, dirty and with inedible food), Chops Grille (which was okay) and Giovanni's Table (where we waited two hours for main courses to be served, and witnessed a Maitre D who loudly bitched to his staff about other customers, after they had raised legitimate complaints). If you do travel on this ship, I'd suggest that you take advantage of the Continental Breakfast which can be delivered to your room, and avoid the Windjammer's hard pancakes and cold eggs. We paid extra for the 'privilege' of eating in Chops Grille and Giovani's Table, and in both cases the fine dining restaurants on other cruise lines left these establishments for dead.The activities and shows onboard are okay, but I'd recommend that you don't bother paying extra money for The Key. Although it makes check in and disembarkment quicker, its promise of exclusive access to activities such as the  Wave Rider, ice skating, laser tag and the Rock Wall is a major let down, as all you are offered is one hour access to each, often at inconvient times such as 9am times. The Key also offers a lunch once you get on board: it this case it was offered between 12 and 1.30pm, but boarding did not start until 1.30pm! Wi Fi is also provided with The Key. It was, however, patchy at best, and like the ship's onboard app would regularly drop out.One last thing must be mentioned: a disco event named RED: The Nightclub Experience. It occurs in Studio B - a location also used for laser tag and the excellent ice skating show - and promises ""excitement, technology, and surprise guests"". Given all the amazing lights I had already seen in this venue, I had big expectations. It turned out to be a room, brightly lit in one solid red lighting state. The LED wall, the dozens of moving 'Vari' lights and the numerous mirror balls in the venue were all unused. It's the first time I'm ever seen a 'nightclub' where the lighting never changes and is all one colour. Onstage an annoyed DJ played some music from a laptop and mixing guest. During the 30 minutes I was there, he twice stopped the music and turned on the lights because of aggression from young males who were behaving badly. Security seemed to ignore both the aggressive young men and the predatory older ones whose sleazy behaviour could be plainly seen under the bright red lighting. They did, however, escort out a young woman and her friends after a bra strap had broken on her dress. It was like attending a dangerous version of a school dance, but one where some creepy uncles were trying to chat up drunk girls half their age. My wife and I left when it seemed that a brawl was about to start.I won't be returning to a Royal Caribbean cruise - unless they wish to employ me to turn their disco into what is promised in their advertising. (Two hours with that lighting desk and I could create a hell of a visual feast). I'd suggest that you do the 3 night sampler with Carnival instead. Unless, of course, you have a thing for terrible food, rude Maitre D.s, inconsistent Wi Fi and broken promises.",Sail Date: February 2020|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Australia|,"Sydney, Australia"

Loved the formal dining and our waiter and assistant were so professional and totally spoilt us.  Quality of food and menu choices were outstanding, we didn’t miss a single night.  Windjammer cafe was pretty hectic this cruise and at times it was difficult to find a seat, but the staff coped so well and were always smiling and helpful and food quality was very good.  There are many places to eat so can’t really complain.  Loved the shows each night and there was a good mix.  Trivia was great but again very crowded and when it was on in the Star Lounge there was a roped off area for frequent cruisers which we thought was strange.  Loved the pool area and the deck above it with loads of sun lounges everywhere and fabulous views.  The bar High Notes on Level 14 was outstanding with a view of all the stuff going on at the various decks below, great place to have a cocktail before dinner.  Also enjoyed R Bar, they had taped Jazz background music some mornings and we liked spending time there after breakfast.  The Deluxe Drinks Package was excellent value, from fresh orange juice and flat whites at breakfast, sparkling mineral water all day, frozen mocktails, Cosmopolitans and Rusty Nails and the odd glass of Chandon, we thought it was awesome.  We did not leave the ship on the tender boats, only if we were alongside.  Duty Free shopping Fung Kuei in Port Vila had the cheapest premium perfume I have ever seen.

I cannot fault them. Even when they are tired and missing their families the still smile and made you welcome. The passengers were the highlight of my trip.   Like the Karaoke, most sounded badly but they made it fun when they call for audience to sing with them as they mock around.  There are activities for singles, teens, children and families. We ate at the main dining all the time and became close to our server. We even offered her to stay with us if she comes to Sydney.The islands were awesome. Again the highlight are the people and culture. The beauty of the scenery.  I rather take flight and stay in the islands then just hop off from the ship and spend a day there though.  Voyager of the Sea is older and smaller than the new onces.  But I cannot complain.  It is clean, staff are good. Shows were ok.  I have seen the Vegas shows from the Caribbean trip and the Voyager's show was less great compared to that but still very good. My buddy loved them all.  Zumba class was great. It was on deck 5. The ship is small so it did not give us much room to move let alone those passengers trying to cross from one end to another.I love the staffs at the jewelry shop. Alex and Maria.I went with a buddy. 10 days cruising to us is too much. We can't wait to leave for the islands and later to hit land to go back home.

Had parents signed consent letter allowing me to take my grandson on cruise but no one mentioned that I’d need a JPs signature. After an hour and a half queueing we finally reached the checkin counter only to be told that this letter of consent wasn’t enough but we had been checked in but still needed to go to another area for further processing. An hour later having managed to get assistance from a crew member and luckily being able to contact my son, he took photos of his Medicare card and license. Not sure why as I’d taken travel insurance for both of us.Finally got through customs to on ship check in only to find the staff had not finished our check in so had to go back to the very start at counter checkin. After complaining that I wasn’t going to join queues again a staff member got me through all relevant areas and checked in.Fault lies with cruise line and travel agent but needless to say it was a stressful start to our cruise. My son is often working where he has no mobile coverage and daughter in law isn’t allowed to have her phone on at work. Other grandparents and parents were having similar issues.Our inside virtual cabin was great apart from safe not unlocking, cabin door had to be fixed three days in a row due to not being able to lock it.

Activities on board was the reason I’d booked this cruise ship but as it was so huge, the queues for everything were either an hour and a half or two hours long most times. Then they got 5-7 minutes doing that activity!They need to have age appropriate session times so that all age groups have the chance to participate for a reasonable time.

This is a major social hub on a cruise.The Diamond Lounge was transfered to a small poky 31 seat lounge where you could rarely get a seat and would sit in the Star Lounge or go somewhere else.Royal seems to be interested in forgetting their loyalty programe and looking after the Suite guests. The fitness centre was moved to the back of the ship, there are no steam rooms or sauna rooms now and no indoor pool.There was no enforcement of washing your hands when you enter the buffet so most people and children walked straight through with dirty hands (there were over 400 passengers with Noro Virus).This was not enforced until several of us complained and what do you know they put two officers at the entry on the second last day to tell people to wash their hands or not to enter, this was too little too late.I have been on Voyager for a number of cruises and won't go on it again.

Despite coming from a $144m refit which added cabins, refurbished many areas, and installed a lot of new leisure facilities, it was the worst of the 3, far below the standard of the previous two. I’m not sure whether to put problems down to the increased number of passengers or if (despite a month of short shakedown cruises out of Singapore before mine) it was a case of more time needed for staff etc to learn new jobs. Maybe both in many cases.PROBLEMS – OVERCROWDING at peak times in areas like  buffet seating, entry to the dining room, the gym, bar and lounges, pool seating, the ice shows …+ several others.Overcrowding also saw the need for a second bus on my Darwin shore excursion. This was a school bus pressed into use – not the aircon coach promised for this 35C day. At one venue excessive attendees were spit – our guide was the gardener pressed into service. He didn’t have a clue. No compensation from the ship.- TENDERING:  I waited 3 hours to get off the ship at Yorkeys Knob (my wife gave up and stayed on board) and stood one hour in the sun to get a tender back. Many returning passengers complained their booked daytrips had to be drastically shortened because of this delay.- SOME UNSKILLED STAFF: some at the help desk didn’t seem to know their derriere from their ulnar.A few bar-staff were unfamiliar with the specials available. Maybe the tendering problems arose from lack of organisational skills.- BARE LIBRARY: even early on there was a marked shortage of books.CAN I SAY SOMETHING NICE?Of course. Embarkation in Singapore was well organised and staffed, particularly since the cruise company was loading another even bigger liner at the time.The captain was exceptional. Wait staff and cabin attendants the usual friendly competents.. Families should benefit from the upgrade – lots of new kid-friendly equipment and facilities.

She is Filipina, a flight attended for 33 years with Cathay Pacific, and applied on line for an Australian Visa, which was granted within 3 days. The problem, so it seems, was the processing of the visa, there is no link between immigration and the cruise liner’s administration! Therefor they have to call immigration in Australia to verify whether the visa was really granted and attached to her passport.I send the granted Australian visa months before boarding to Vacationstogo travel agent Lex Harrison and the Royal Caribbean Cruise line, when checking in on line, everything was fine, no questions asked.2 weeks before sailing I received the boarding pass and luggage tags, late because we are interline (airline crew) and therefor got our stateroom assigned shortly before sailing.It took 45 minutes at the check in counter, with many officers involved to get the “GO” signal.It was a humiliating experience, which flashed in my mind as a racial approach.Not from the officers that only did their job as instructed by their superiors and acted courteous and polite.But the fact that despites ALL our pre-check-in efforts, NOBODY of Royal Caribbean seemed to check the documents, but only AFTER we were about to board the ship and to than make us feel like fraudsters, because their processing procedure was faulty!  The correct procedure should be that every passenger should submit their visa, in time on line to the cruise liner involved and not when passengers were boarding the ship and therefor prevent the passenger to be treated like a criminal for no reason at all.Another unfortunate experience is the MUSTER CALL.We had to endure 45 minutes in the heat and humidity on deck 4, Reason? Waiting for late comers! It took 5 minutes for the drill.  Late comers should be penalized.Sunday mass for the devoted Catholics is at 9.00 AM, but the breakfast starts at 8.00 AM. However the Queue takes 45 minutes to get you to your table. Was it ALL a mistake? …..NOThe ship “Voyager of the Seas’, a 20 year old , newly refurbished cruise ship, great nostalgic interior architecture, well thought of economic designed staterooms, is quite cozy.Except for the Sky chapel, which is completely out of line with the rest of the ship, cold, white chalked with huge, white Aphrodite inspired, sculptures.The food is ok, but not as good as Princess or Norwegian, not many variations, shows ok, but the sound mix bad, singers are screaming and screeching due to overpowering volume and wrong equalizer settings, lyrics completely wasted. The ice skating show very impressive. The top of the bill was the acrobat duo…from Ukraine and Italy. Amazing performance. Talked to Cruise Director Michelle about the sound and I must say it improved a bit in the next show. Two singers: one 25th year old USA male and a …..Italian girl.  The male singer performed well, the girl should stick to controlled love songs and ballads and not Freddie Mercury’s “Somebody “.  She has a lovely voice, but when howling out it becomes unbearable.The wine tasting: 5 wines: 2 white, 2 red, 1 sparkling……2 were as planned, 3 replaced by inferior ones, due to late arrival in Singapore of the feature ones, missed the boat. Complained to the beverage manager, felt cheated. So sorry, send a nice bottle of New Zealand wine with 2 glasses to the stateroom.    The Port dockings on this repositioning cruise were absolutely un-interesting, either far off the coast on Anker, so boat transport required, which took very long to execute, or docking in an industrial area, 45 minutes with shuttle bus from town.  The newly refurbished staterooms on Deck 3 were noisy at night, due to cleaning or other activities above the staterooms. Staff: very pleasant, helpful and attentive. Stateroom attendant Kadek Sukma from Indonesia excellent. Headwaiter Kai and waiter Ryan in dining room very pleasant, did a great job.

We have cruised extensively but never with Royal Caribbean so we took the opportunity. First thing I'd like to make clear is that we cruise to relax as we both still work so if it's quiet time or space you're after, then look elsewhere.The entertainment on the ship was fine if you're in the party mood. The bars and lounges mainly look onto the Promenade that runs through the middle of the ship, and that is a hub of constant activity with music or entertainment happening somewhere nearby. The High Bar on level 14 is quiet but you need to get the early to get a seat.The standard of food on our cruise in the Windjammers buffet was exceptional for the entire cruise. Great selections and great quality. The speciality Italian was also top-notch and shouldn't be missed.Down side - There is NO information available about ports that you visit so if you don't want to do the organised tours, do your homework before you start you cruise. The use of US Dollars on board is a killer (if you're not American) so you really need to be aware of what you're spending. Even on longer cruises, you might be worthwhile looking at the drinks packages as once you buy a and convert every drink you buy to Oz dollars, it can be very expensive.

The hallway as you walked further towards the back of ship smelt moist and mouldy. They were trying to assist with the smell throughout the cruise but couldn’t disguise it. They really shouldn’t be selling these rooms. Short cruise so you want to do a lot of the activities. You get a program when you get on. Quiz in schooners lounge was at 7pm. At 715 pm still nothing when we made enquiries as did others. At 730 pm we walked away. Buffet was a nightmare at breakfast. Couldn’t find seating and it was bedlam. Dinner the food was terrible at the buffet and would not do that again. Dining room the food was lovey service was great however we were surprised when our lead waiter did not know what a dessert wine was. International ship travelling internationally. During the cruise we would go to the sports bar for a couple of drinks and game or two of uno. We would sit quietly and enjoy our time together. Extremely drunk people in the bar but still served alcohol - where is responsible service of alcohol?  The last night we were sitting at a table and over heard a request come from another guest that he needed the bar area for his group. Total of 40 people. There was no reserved signs on any table and pretty much we were told to move. At that stage we were being stared down by the 40 people. It was disappointing that we were less valued as a guest as we were 2 people. Given really no choice even though we said we were fine and they could sit around us. Pretty much told to get out. Disembarkation was not organised at all, no Johnny rockets onboard after we were directed to it by a couple of staff members, hounded everywhere we went to go to a speciality restaurant, possibly asked 20 times this question on the first day, be wary of pre-purchasing alcohol packages as when we got onboard they had a deal of buy one, get 2nd 50% off.

A team takes a few months to gel together and we could see that, but did not detract from the service we received. There were a few things that weren't finished to their usual standard, I suspect they had to meet a deadline to meet this cruise. The Balcony Room was as it appeared on the website, and our attendant supplied the usual newsletters and towel animals, and conversation...just use the magnets on the door to indicate the room is ready to be made up.The buffet was better than other Cruise Lines as we expected and the 3 main dining room meals we had were as expected, though the steak I had on the 3rd night was superbly cooked (r) and was tastey as. On the last night, our waiter supplied me, at my request a desert from the previous night and his desert recommendation just for a taste.The tours we picked were great, although a couple of things went unexpectedly wrong from external factors, the guides did their utmost to make the experience enjoyable....chill out people its a holiday!All the shows were very enjoyable, but again a few more performances will sharpen up the presentation and avoid the wardrobe malfunctions.Got to say I spent a few hours on the Flow Rider. The crew there certainly look after the guests, they have fun and the guest have fun. Well done to them.My observations that could be improved, 1. The check in process in my line took an extra 15-30 mins due to the way the lanes had been organised. long line and not enough attendants.....or we could have jump line or checked in at a different time. 2. there was no general store that excited us....lots of the usual fancy stuff, jewelry, perfume, watches, handbags, paintings.We like RC so expectations were achieved and will again, after an upcoming Carnival cruise.",Sail Date: October 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Asia|,"Caloundra, Australia"

The medical staff were very helpful, comforting and easy to get on with, Unfortunately I was quarantined for the rest of the journey, potentially due to a dodgy prawn in our previous stop of Bali. My wife carried on with the large amount of activities on board with my brother and sister in law and took some of the organised excursions. I on the other hand was continually summonsed to the med centre for more medicine and fluids. the cabin manager visited a minimum twice a day to change bedding due to the quarantine, but also stayed to chat if I needed. My wife thoroughly enjoyed her cruise and found the deluxe drinks package to be good value for money. At the end of the cruise, I awoke to find a note on my door from the ships crew stating I would be refunded for my quarantined days by way of a voucher for a further holiday, which was unexpected. I was also refunded my deluxe drinks package and my internet. Contact with the after sales team has also been great, with phone calls from Florida to UK to check on me and emails sorting out my refunds and ensuring they reached me.Overall, I was disappointed with my holiday experience, but I was ill, so who wouldn't?

Unfortunately, they refused to give us a refund, a credit for other cruise or any other perk, except a free bottle of wine for our troubles.

Almost before a month of the actual trip, we received an email from them saying that they cannot go to Malacca due to rough sea and so they are changing the location from Malacca to Bintan (which is like 1 hour ferry from Singapore and we have been there so many times). We still accepted it because no one can argue with the nature!Rooms:We booked 2 State rooms with Balcony and both the rooms had bung bed which our kids liked a lot and enjoyed it. Rooms were clean and neat. Water:First day they provided 2 small bottles of water. After that no more water bottles for the rest of the trip. Before the trip, I read in one of the Royal Caribbean blog that they don't provide water bottles, but we can fill water from Cafe Promenade. But in Cafe Promenade, there is a notice saying, ""In the Interest of Public Health No Refilling water bottles"". So basically, they want us to buy water packages. If they are so concerned about environment (not using plastic bottles or public health), they should have a place to fill water in each floor rather than expecting people to run to restaurant for water or buy expensive water bottles on board. At least you can provide 2 bottles of water bottles per day and if they want more, you can charge the customer. With a kid on room, we need to keep running around for Water.Restaurants:Cafe Promenade has a setting capacity of 50 people and that's the only restaurant providing water, tea, coffee and snacks all time. So, most of the times, people are standing in queue. Main Dining room Sapphire experience was good and the food was also good. Windjammer was more like a big market and extremely crowded most of the times. All restaurants are always full and we have to wait for our turn to find a seat. Mostly people are standing next to you waiting for you to finish your food especially during morning breakfast (in Windjammer).Shore Excursion:We booked for a shore excursion at 8.00 am. We went to Windjammer (11th floor) around 7.45 am for breakfast but it was overcrowded and so they didn't allow us inside. They asked us to wait for some time or go to Main Dining room (3rd floor). We rushed to main dining room and somehow, we had a quick breakfast. We rushed to the La Scala theatre at 8.15 am and we were late by 15 min. The staff (2 ladies who were handling the tours on 1st May 2019) were extremely rude and they simply told that we are late, and we cannot do anything now. We asked them if they can accommodate on some other excursion because they simply refused to even hear us. At that point, most of the people are still waiting to get down from Cruise.  Also, they said we cannot refund the amount we booked for the shore excursion (around 700 USD). Finally, we requested an Australian guy (who is helping the Shore excursion – forgot to take note of his name at that point) and he helped to talk to his manager and took us outside the ship. From there somehow, we managed to hire a taxi and managed to reach to the 1st attraction and join the excursion we booked. But the staff behavior was extremely rude and shocking. They don't want to help the guest!! Child Care:This is the worst part of the trip. Myself and my wife's brother family decided to drop the kid in the kid's play zone (Adventure Ocean). The Staff asked us to fill up a form. I filled both the forms and signed the form for my kid and asked my wife's brother to sign for his kid. But the guy refused to accept the form saying my wife’s brother should fill his own form and I should not fill the form for him. I did explain the points mentioned in the form (like if your kid allergic to any food etc) to my wife's brother and he signed the form after going through the details. But the staff simply refused to accept the form. He was extremely rude in his behavior and we decided not to drop the kid in such an unfriendly place. We didn't feel it's a safe place for kids. Either the staff was over exhausted or simply they don't want to engage kids anymore. We hardly saw any kid in Adventure Ocean and that shows how they are handling the kids. The kids were obviously disappointed. Also, some of the video games in Arcade are not working (Example: we tapped our card and started a Candy Crush game, but the touch screen was not working. So, you cannot play the game and you end up losing the game as well as the money used for the game)Pool:In the last day of our trip (in Bintan) we decided to stay in Cruise and enjoy the pool and facilities. In the daily Campus, it was mentioned that pool will open from 9 am. But we waited till 10 am the pool was closed. Finally, they told they are opening only one small side of the pool and the rest of the main pools will be closed. When we asked a life guard, no specific reason (Simply they don't want to open the pool and maintain it) Overall, my Royal Caribbean experience was unpleasant and totally disappointing. The Staffs are not welcoming (except very few) and exhausted (maybe need a break). But it's not worth for the money we booked the balcony Staterooms!

This was nowhere near as good this time with uninterested crew and the organisation which was chaotic at best.At Laem Chabang (Bangkok) for instance we were told to wait in the Windjammer in order to get off the ship to clear immigrations, but we could not get in as people who had breakfast were reluctant to give up their table so waited outside.As it was mandatory to clear immigration  whether you wanted to or not the whole ship had to disembark and wait in the small terminal for well over three hours in very hot conditions. There was little refreshments or information so people who thought this would be a short exercise were roaming around with no money. Getting back onboard was more long queues and a lady who had difficulty getting her husband in a wheelchair up the gangway had to ask the passengers around her to help while the crew looked on. Having a suite made no real difference as we could not use the compass lounge and had the same cookies placed in the cabin as everyone else. The food was OK but in the windjammer the staff  seemed to be rationing the food rather than serving it, to get another slice of beef at lunch earned me a surly smile from the chef.

If I'd give previous cruise 5 stars, Crystal gets easily 10.Everything was just perfect from the speedy and warm embarking in Miami right thru till disembarking in Costa Rica.The cabin wasn't large but adequate and maintained perfectly. Our maid was efficient and friendly. We are easy customers nd had no real demands here. The one time though we ordered room service it was incredibly efficient and speedy.As for dining, we ordered kosher style so ate every evening in the main dining room - Waterside. All the cheers go to Crystal on this superb dining service for Kosher travels. What a difference from the regular kosher airline meals..Our Head Waiter - Santana - asked us every evening what we'd like for the following evening and ever little request was answered quickly with a "" done "". Nothing was too much for him, unbelievable service. There was a choice of 3 kosher wines too, so the meals were perfect.The other meals we ate in the upstairs regular buffet which had more than enough choice to meet our dietary needs. As for the service - not only was it efficient but super friendly. We really felt that we were honored guests and all the staff couldn't do enough for us.The cruise included all drinks - a real pleasure eve though we aren't big drinkers.The entertainment program every night was varied  and of a high quality suitable to the average age of the cruisers 55++. The lectures were also varied and particularly good giving the background for crossing the canal.We did some of the land tours with Crystal and particularly enjoyed Colonial Panama and The Orchid farm and Coffee Plantation in Costa Rica - superb guide Percy.Aword of praise too for the Spa service.

This was our first with them, but my 35th sailing, and let me tell you, it was NICE. Cabin 8027 was much like those on Celebrity or Cunard but with a larger bathroom equipped with a tub as well as a shower. The best thing about Crystal though was the food. Simply excellent. We ate mostly in the main dining room but also enjoyed Churascaria and Prego. The last night my husband was not well so we had room service from the dining room menu: just as good as in the DR. We don’t do shows so I can’t comment on them, but the several musicians offering lounge music we’re very good. We also liked not having to sign for anything — it was all included. Unfortunately the last experience was the worst: Transfer to the Pullman Hotel to relax in their lounge with refreshments and WiFi and then a late afternoon transfer to the airport. Sounded like a good way to kill the long wait for our flight. NOT! The Pullman May be nice, but our “lounge” turned out to be the hotel lobby, loud and already near full. This after sitting in the van for 30 minutes as the transport company stumbled getting their act together. They put people on, took them off, couldn’t find people from their list and had other people on the van who were not on their list (us for example).  So after all that frustration we Uber’d to the airport once we saw the lobby-only situation. The Admiral’s Club is FAR NICER than a hotel lobby anyway.

The food, service and entertainment did not disappoint, it is without question outstanding.That said I will have to take away two stars on this trip for two reasons.First they were remodeling the cruise ship while we were sailing, it was not fully ready to sail but they decided to do it anyway. We had issues with stuff in the hallways during most of the cruise.  Our cabin experience was in it during a portion of the sail which was to me unacceptable for what this cruise cost.Secondly, they offered us a cruise on a another ship later for a reduction of 50% for the second person if we book while on board, sort of a token for all the headaches we had during our cruise.  So we booked it, but only to find after we exited the ship and got a letter a few weeks later telling us they would not honor the offer.I am not one to write a long story about something, bottom line is they should have honor the trip and for that they lost my wife and I as customers for good, but it appears from my conversation with office officials ""no big deal"" to them.",Sail Date: December 2018|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Mediterranean|,

The captain spoiled us with a very close view of the Hubbard Glacier and another one in Tracy Arm, that larger ships couldn't do.

So I'm very familiar with these ships.I've gone through the changes over the past few years and I'm a bit disappointed with some of the quality and changes made to these two ships I love.First, I sailed a couple years after Crystal switched to All-Inclusive back in 2012 and was worried things would change and not for the better.  However, I was a bit surprised.  I hadn't seen many changes at that time.Then in 2015, when Crystal Cruises was purchased by another Cruise company, I was very worried because they began growing too fast.  I couldn't wait to get back onboard to see the changes.The recent overhaul on the Symphony was amazing & beautifully done.  Having said this, I had a couple of issues with other Crystal inconsistencies. There is the new Brazilian Steakhouse, Churrascaria, located on deck 11 where, during the day there is a breakfast & lunch buffet!  At night they turn it over.  I've been on an NCL ship that started out with one of these restaurants and I hate to say this, but it was better run and the food was better.  Sorry Crystal!The food in the Specialty restaurants was amazing as usual!!  We took out two times at Umi Uma & the Sushi Bar and then paid for our time at Prego!  Totally worth the $30ppThere were a couple of instances where something didn't go right, such as a shipboard credit that wasn't honored.  It took quite a bit of finagling, but at the last minute, it was included.Will I ever sail on Crystal Cruises again, you bet your sweet (ness) I most certainly will.

All of theses cruise lines have very similar ships which hold approximately 850 passengers. The difference is in the service and amenities and there really is no comparison. Crystal has excellent speakers who give lectures on what you will see and visit on the cruise. If the other ships even had speakers they were very limited. On our ship the wait staff learned our names on the first day and on each day thereafter we were greeted by name and were immediately served with our favorite items without having to ask. All crew members are friendly and will greet you whenever you pass them, even the general ship crew members. While Viking and Oceania are both adequate it is like comparing a Toyota Camry to a BMW.

Tony Zinni]; the political goings-on in DC and the USA from Tom DeFrank; and Sir Michael Burton on the coming down of the Berlin Wall and other insightful historical events, oriented around the parts of the world we were visiting [e.g. China].The only aspect of the trip that was a little underwhelming were some of the shore excursions - often one place was really worth visiting, but bookended with shopping or other lesser attractions, one could easily forego.

I was assured the balcony room so I booked it. The guy said it's a great deal and I should act straight away by giving him my credit card details and name. This was odd cause he asked for nothing else I said I will call back asap and book it so he reserved the balcony room and gave me a reservation number. Long storey short when I get on the boat I didn't have a balcony. I had to wait until 10 pm to be told there is no balcony rooms available and to come back later. I found this extremely annoying. It makes me angry that they advertise this deal and then they get you to book a more expensive room in the off chance they have a balcony. In my eyes it's very dishonest to assure someone a room when you know they are all booked up just to get a bit of extra money. What annoyed me the most is that I was told by the staff on board that my phone call to book the room never happened. After giving them the time frame in which I called and the number. So after being accused of piecing and being shunned to all these different people I'm quite pissed off with my cruise. The wait staff and bar tenders and all them were amazing but they were not willing to look into this further. So I spent extra money for nothing I could have gone the cheaper room and had more money to spend on my holiday. Once It was insinuated that my reservation never happened I found out that they had given a balcony room to another family as they didn't like being so close to the kitchen. So so much for not having any rooms left. I'm so angry and disgusted that they advertised this and didn't follow through. It's a nice ship and all but I doubt I will be going on it again. My holiday was ruined the miniute I found out I had been shunned. If you book with this company get it in writing what your paying for and the time you called. Although it didn't help me it might save you from being scammed.,Sail Date: March 2020|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Australia|,

Being we had never been on such a lengthy cruise we chose to upgrade to a Junior Suite.  Our suite #8232 was very spacious.  Our Stateroom Attendant, Herianto, did a fantastic job.   We had prepurchased the Deluxe Beverage and  Voom(WIFI)  package ahead of time.  To purchase it onboard was approx. $15. per person per day additional.  The entertainment on board was very enjoyable from the shows to the activities.  We did the IFly which was very fun.  The instructor was very informative.  We also did the Northstar which I would recommend to do on a day that you are in port.  There is really not much to see but the ship.  We also did the GoKarts which was fun but the line was always at least 45 minutes long so we only did it once.  We had reservations for Pixels which was entertaining but the shows at the Royal Theatre were much better.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Solarium.  Never felt crowded or couldn't find a chair.  Wait staff was excellent here.Excursions:  We cruised thru the Sounds which were spectacular.  Dunedin:  Was cancelled due to bad weather.  We had purchased an excursion with the Cruiseline which was credited back to our cruise account. The savings for this excursion by  prebooking was $31.00 per person.  Wellington:  We had prebooked a tour thru Coastal Kiwi Tours we had found on Trip Advisor.  See my review on Trip Advisor.  Exceptional and excellent guide Craig/Owner.  Highly recommend.Tauranga:  We booked this  overcrowded tour with the  cruiseline.  The bus was jammed packed and hot.  We went to Rotorua to visit Hells Gate and Jet Boat Ride.The jet boat ride was not what we were expecting.   Others seemed to enjoy just wasn't our cup of tea.  Shopped around town after excursion which was quite easy and short walk back to the ship.Auckland:  Today took a ferry into port.  Being on an excursion with the cruiseship we met beforehand at the Royal Theatre.  Took the Town and Country Tour.  Enjoyed the sheepsheering show at Sheepworld.  Wish we would of had more time here.  Next we stopped at a pub on the way back.  The pub was packed with locals, bikers and other tourists.  We had snacks with tea that were tasty.  Chatted with locals before heading back.  The bus today was much more comfortable and not as packed as the day before. The driver was very knowledgeable and informative.   After the excursion we shopped around town which was heavily under construction.  Being it was Sunday only the shopping was open.  All employees were heavily masked in the City.  Much easier when the ship is docked than having to take a ferry back to the ship.Bay of Islands:  Took a Lunch Boat Cruise today.  We went to Russell Island which offers very few shops and nothing to do.  The captain of the boat was very humorus and the lunch was very good.  Once again it was to crowded.  If they would of even had 10 less people on board it would of made a difference.  After the excursion went into town and shopped until we took the long ferry ride back to the boat.  Sydney:  We had a late flight so we took the excursion to the Blue Mountains.  The driver and tour guide were very good.   Do this tour when you have more time.  Such a beautiful place to be rushed through.   We were under the understanding that the excursion would take us to the airport by 4:00 pm.  We were there at 2:00 pm which gave us over 4 hours to wait for our flight.  Dining:  DO NOT BRING DRESS CLOTHES!!!  We had not cruised in 6 years and were shocked that anything goes in the main dining room.  We had packed suits, ties, dresses etc that took up way to much room in our luggage.  We are not complaining but would rather wear jeans, shorts and sandals to dinner any day!  The Windjammer has gone down hill.  The food was worse than any Golden Coral.  No variety same thing day after day.  You know it is bad when you go to get a hot dog without a bun because they have been sitting there forever.  Plus who gets a hot dog at a buffet?  The Main Dining Room no longer has filet mignon or lobster.  They have a significant up charge.  The main dining room for lunch is probably your best choice being they change the entrees slightly each day plus you can have them make you a tossed salad.  The breakfast is the same exact choices each day.  We went to the Two70 for breakfast which offered breakfast sandwhiches, bagels, cereals etc.  At lunch they have carved beef sandwiches, paninis and salads.  Sorentos had pizza which was the same each day.  All places had little to NO variety.  COASTAL KITCHEN:  Being we were junior suite guest we could only go here for dinner.  The food here is exceptional.  We would rate five stars here.  The service is exceptional from the moment you walk through the door.  Our favorite waiter, Roderick, did an exceptional job. Please see all the savory photos!   If you are on the fence for upgrading make this place be your deciding factor!  They also have a program called Royal up which allows you to bid on higher cabins so keep this place in mind.  There were sanitizers and washing sinks everywhere on the ship not just in dining areas.  They had a crazy person singing washy washy daily so one could never forget!I always say it is not the destination you seek it is the people you meet along the way.  Being American I would say the majority of the passengers were from Australia, New Zealand and the UK.  We enjoyed the staff from all over the globe.

Relaxing! Busy! Can't wait to go back!,"Hubby and I absolutely loved our first Royal Caribbean Cruise, on Ovation of the Seas, in October 2019...around New Zealand's south island.- EMBARKATION was delayed and lengthy due to the ship encountering rough seas approaching Oz, however we had bought The Key so instead of taking 1.5-2+ hours to board, we were on in 15-20 minutes.- OUR CABIN (balcony - 9206) was excellent...very comfortable...spacious...well appointed. We asked for mattress toppers to make the beds a bit for comfy. Loved our balcony...not sure if we'd get one again if heading to a cool climate, but definitely on warmer cruises.- STAFF were lovely...friendly, professional, hard working.- FOOD...there were many great spots to chill out in. We enjoyed the food in The Main Dining Room, the Bistro in the Solarium, most cafe's and food courts. The Windjammer had a pretty good variety and quality most often, however we did prefer to eat elsewhere most of the times (although I loved my granola, yoghurt & dried fruit...hubby loved his poached eggs, bacon and toast...and sausages etc. ;) ). We could've had a continental brekky delivered by room service every day (free) however we were keen to get out-and-about ASAP.- DRINKS...we bought the Deluxe Drink Package. It was lovely to be able to grab a drink (alcoholic or not) any time without worrying about a nasty surprise on the credit card at the end of the cruise (especially considering average prices are $12USD = about $20AUD onboard, unless they were on special). I wouldn't buy the deluxe package again if on a short cruise under 5 days, I don't think...pretty sure I'd get it again if 5+ days. - ENTERTAINMENT / ACTIVITIES...we loved the entertainment (games, shows etc.)...didn't get to see / do everything...just have to make sure we take another Ovation cruise. ;) We found there was lots to do. Hubby was often in the cabin resting so I spent a fair bit of time on my own, checking the place out...but I was rarely alone...so many lovely fellow cruisers to chat with. Not all performers / performances were our cup-of-tea, but then we liked entertainment that others didn't. Can be lengthy queues for some activities though e.g. bumper cars, some shows etc.- POOLS & SUNDECKS...lovely. Plenty of places to go - in the sun, out of the sun, with others, in quieter areas, with kids, adults only areas...excellent.- OVATION ITSELF...we were in awe from the moment we embarked. She's huge. Seriously is a floating city. So clean...well designed...well staffed. And did I say huge? ;) Some passengers said they preferred smaller ships, but the majority I met also loved her.There's so much more to say about Ovation...you just need to give her a go yourself! :D ;)",Sail Date: October 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: South Pacific|,

No slow waltzes at all.  The Boleros lounge floor is tiles and way too small and hard to dance on.

Cruising has always included a wow factor of excellent service, with staff who want to see you have a great time … that did not apply on Ovation of the Seas.The ship’s facilities just do not manage the number of passengers. You can stand in a pool, but you couldn’t swim, it’s just too crowded. Not sure who thought an adult pool 80cm deep was a great idea?  Waiting 10 minutes for an elevator is normal. Waiting for the next elevator, because this one is full, is also normal. Food is lukewarm .... you just don’t ever get a hot meal. Long waits for restaurant bookings are common .... the ship just cannot manage the capacity of 5000 passengers. Bumper-cars looked like fun, but an hour wait for a ride was the norm, and that was replicated over and over on the cruise activities.With the exception of Vlad, in the Wonderland speciality dining, there were very few wow factor experiences with service. Rosemarie in Jamie’s Italian was excellent too. The staff were generally pleasant, but there was also a pervasive miserableness in the staff, that we’ve never seen on cruise ships. The structural problem of too many passengers shows in the staff culture. The staff appear to have all worked out that no matter what they do, it’s never going to a quality experience. For the number of passengers, the ship’s facilities are woefully inadequate. It’s clearly destroyed staff morale.   Kaitlyn, a souvenir shop attendant epitomised it – no greeting, just an unsolicited comment “Only 29 sea days and I get to go home”.  Chops Grille, another speciality restaurant has zero ambience, with the doors left open to the karaoke bar, and they resist closing the glass door. If you like paying for fine dining in a karaoke bar, it’d be excellent. Side dishes arrived after every person on our table had finished mains.  Per chance, we ate at Chops three times, and on the final occasion, had Marko look after us, and he was excellent, which was totally different to the prior occasions.  The cruise ship itself is at a premium price point, and everything on the ship is expensive and in US dollars, with a set 18% gratuity. A glass of Australian wine, for a cruise out of Australia, is $14US, plus 18%, so nearly $17, and that’s more than a bottle in any bottle shop. If you are paying top dollar, but getting a wow factor experience with food and service, then it’s justified, but this is c-grade experience at a-grade prices.We’ve been on Royal Caribbean ships before (and belong to their Crown and Anchor membership program) but nothing would induce us to book another trip on Ovation of the Seas.",Sail Date: December 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Australia|,"Perth, Australia"

Glacier and waterfall tour in Skagway is great if you're in really good condition to run out to the waterfall and take some really awesome pix of it and the glacier. If you don't already have a good camera with a minimum 200mm zoom lens. Rent one. Bring a 64GB card. I took about 2000 photos. Spa, not worth it. Bands are usually fun and entertaining.

Tips - do your research of the ship, e.g. get a room where you want eg close to dinning or if you have mobility issues, go through a travel agent - they know a lot more than you and at same price, don't buy onshore packages as they cost a lot more (5X) than if you got them yourself unless you really do not want to miss out and plan your days out and just take it easy - its just a plan you need not commit.

We have completed numerous cruises with 10 cruise lines in the past. This was the first and last with Royal Caribbean. Although we experienced the White Island Volcano disaster which was well handled by the Captain and crew our general experience was well below expectation.FIRST THE POSITIVES -- Crew and staff were courteous and did a terrific job, particularly Roul our cabin steward.-The food was fine, however, it was the same in every complimentary dining area.-The balcony stateroom, although a slight bit small was fine.-The ship was always clean and shining.NOW FOR THE NEGATIVES.-For the size of the ship the number of lifts was pathetic. Did not matter at what time you went to use them there was always a wait. We have cruised on a similar sized ship that had double the number of lifts and never experienced problems like this.-The corridors were narrow and usually cluttered with the cleaners trolles.-The Stateroom beds were that hard, it felt like you were sleeping on a solid timber mattress.-You had to search for a powerpoint in the bathroom and its location was ridiculous.-There were no slippers, shower robes or toiletries in the staterooms.(Except Soap).-Coffee, orange juice and Ice cream in the complementary restaurants. At different meal times it was free and help yourself at other meal times you had to pay for it. Just ridiculous.- Disembarking times. If you went ashore yourself the times it took were unbelievable. At the Bay of Islands we went to the designated area and got our ticket and it took in excess of 2 hours till we arrived in the town. It was similar in Auckland where it took 1 hour and 40 minutes. -Drink packages. With the cost you paid you needed to drink from early morning till late night to get your value and many people did.-Tours. Prices were over the moon. If you googled the tour you could get the same tour at less than half price.-Internet. Another ripoff. We have experienced the supply on other cruises at less than half the price.-Pay to dine restaurants. Before sailing I looked on the Cruise's website to find a seafood one. After not finding one I contacted Royal Caribbean by phone. I was advised that the Chops Restaurant was the only one where you could get a seafood meal. As it was my wife's birthday I booked and paid to dine there at lunch time. When we went for lunch there was only Prawn Cocktails on the menu(which were free in other dining rooms) and we were told that we should have booked for Dinner time. Also, you could get the likes of Lobster if you wished to pay some ridiculous price. At this time we asked for a refund which we did get and visited a Club on the same wharf as the ship and had the best seafood platter for 2 for $40.-No reserving seats- This is published in your daily newsletters, on the screen in the main Royal theatre, however, every night on the 5th floor there is half the seating blocked off for Diamond members. Most nights there would only be one or 2 seated there until minutes before the show. On the 4th floor seating, again there were always quite a number of seats blocked off for star members. So much for No Reserve Seating.-Shows. Except for a couple of shows the remainder were pathetic. Most people we spoke to agreed. One night they had a bloke juggling tennis balls and told 2 jokes. Wow, they really excelled with this one. Most believed they got the cheapest and worst that must have been available.",Sail Date: December 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Australia|,"Hervey Bay, Australia"

It is advisable to be aware that going to the ships can be very expensive.The ship itself is huge but cluttered with problems getting around due to narrow passageways and obstacles badly placed (i.e. Christmas tree, photography setups).

The state rooms are well appointed and the virtual balcony (when it works) is an added luxury.The dinning is excellent if you have no allergies or intolerances.

Not a problem for me, but be aware that everything charged to your seapass card (or WOW band) on board, will be in US$.

Been on a few Royal Caribbean ships now - all of those out of Florida. This one though, was the first for me out of an Australian port and I have to say, sadly, if you have little kids with you, be prepared for exposure to bad language. A few 'F-bombs' in the elevators and generally around the pool deck. Other than that, the ship itself was fine. Long queues to ride in the North Star (suggest pre booking for that).

Preregistering makes all the difference.Activities that the girls participated in were:  The Flow Rider, rock wall, roller skating,  trapeze, and the children's pools.  Yes, there were about 5,000 guests, but other than waiting for wrist bands for the skating and trapeze, they were able to do what they wanted. *Note:  if you and your child want to skate, try the trapeze or ride the bumper cars, get to the area (deck 14) at least 1/2 hr. early and then you'll receive wristbands that will let you know when to come back for your turn.  That way the rink area is never over-crowded.We chose the MyTime diningroom and ate at the same time, same table and served by the same wait staff.  It was definitely one of our highlights having such attentive and fun men...Praveen and Ziming were top notch, giving the girls special attention and even having daily riddles or showing them how to make a flower with their napkin. The meat was always tender and delicious, but the sides and desserts were only adequate or I would have given the cruise a rating of 5.The ship is only 3 yrs. old and instead of being ""lavishly gaudy"" it had wonderful artwork including a fabulous wall of butterflies.

Alaska is just straight up amazing and picturesque. It would have been great to ditch a sea day and do an overnight in Juno. I am sure that would cost RC a fortune. Biggest complaint, food quality. Too salty, too bland, too much. If you did not pony up the big bucks for specialty dinning, they truly give you the basics. My husband and I feel that you could have a better experience flying to Alaska, eating out, and hiring a private tour guide and still save money compared to the price of this cruise.

This was our first cruise. For starters this ship is huge! It holds around 6,000 people (including staff). The interior is very modern and feels new. We had an inside cabin with the virtual balcony - our 15 year old son has motion sickness issues so it was recommended to chose an inner cabin. He wore a motion sickness patch and had no issues with sea sickness so that was good. The virtual balcony was nice to have since it did give you some idea if the boat was moving or what the weather was like outside but the definition isn't super sharp and the screen would turn all green at times. The food is tasty - Windjammer actually seemed to have the best overall food. We ate in the Grande room downstairs for dinner with our extended family. The service on the ship is good. All the staff is very friendly. The shows are great too. The only issue we had was the cruise was supposed to include seeing the Dawes Glacier but that was cancelled because there was too much ice in the channel. That was very disappointing so I think RC should be more upfront about this and not include it as an official stop. We saw tons of humpback whales, Dalls porpoises, puffins, eagles and some people saw orcas. I actually saw one bear when we went up the Endicot Arm so that was cool. Definitely bring a good set of binoculars so you can see all the sea life up close. While in Skagway we took the Chilkoot Trail Hike and Float Tour (Skagway Float Tours). Our guide Rebecca was amazing.  When we were in Juneau we visited Mendenhall Glacier - definitely take a shuttle, some people take the city bus but that drops you off 1.5 miles from the visitor center and after hiking around the glacier the last thing you'll want to do is walk 1.5 miles back to the city bus stop - especially if the weather is bad.",Sail Date: July 2019|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: Family (older kids)|Destination: Alaska|,"Cerritos, California"

There are many staterooms with outside balconies and public areas with huge windows for inside viewing the beautiful landscapes during any cold or windy times, as well as the outside decks for calmer times.

The Sea Plex kept the kids & teens well entertained with an arcade, skating & bumper cars, basketball, volleyball, dodgeball, shuffleboard, table tennis, etc. Never overly crowded or unpleasant. They were very well organized. Other amenities included the flow rider, rock wall, 2 outdoor pools, 2 indoor pools, 8 whirlpools, casino, arcade, fitness center, & spa.We spent our pool time in the Solarium hot tubs and pools as they had huge windows to see the water and land & no kids in this area. The scenery was amazing to enjoy. They did have 2 pools for kids with slides, floating rivers, etc. and they seemed to enjoy it greatly when we walked by. The pools were open early in the morning until 11:00 PM which was great. You could really enjoy them. On other cruises, they always closed so early and we never got a chance to use them. Even though this ship had many passengers, it never felt overcrowded or unpleasant in the pool areas. We were always able to find a seat by the windows or in the pools to enjoy.They also had an outdoor movie screen mid ship after the kid pools closed for evening movies. This was the only one to close early evening. Only negative was that the movies didn’t capture our attention. We would have enjoyed other options for viewing. The Royal Esplanade had multiple shops but not as many as on other classes of RCI. Very small area to explore. There were some ‘sidewalk’ sales, but not one was ever pushy to get you to buy. Very pleased with this, as it was fun to just look and peruse. There were a lot of specialty restaurants on this ship, more so than others. Wonderland – delicious food with a mysterious setting. It was interesting. Jamie’s Italian – the best food & pasta on the whole ship! Chops Grille – great seafood & steaks. Did not disappoint. Izumi – Japanese cuisine that was outstanding. TIP: Book your reservations prior to sailing as the restaurants are small and seating is limited. We did all 4 of these restaurants and were glad we did as it gave us some other options besides the main dining room food, and we didn’t get bored with our food options.  We did the My Time Dining and were very pleased. We pre-booked our time and we never had to wait. There are 4 main dining rooms on this ship. Two are dedicated to set dining times (Silk & The Grande. 5:15 or 8 PM) and two are dedicated to MTD option (American Icon Grill or Chic). All the menus are the same, you just choose the décor environment you would like to sit in. The food was amazing. We were never disappointed in the dining rooms. We were impressed and never left hungry. Service was outstanding!There were plenty of bars with entertainment options in the daytime & evenings- music & games. We were never bored with choices here. Schooners was a great bar with great service & lots of entertainment. Loved Bolero’s for the evening music and drinks. TIPS: Room service was $7.95 per order w/ gratuity. Order what you want, and this was the set fee. This was really nice on mornings we were in the Inside passage and in Glacier Bay, as we could have coffee on our balconies and see the scenery. Café Promenade had the best coffee on the ship. If we didn’t get room service coffee this is where we went every morning. They stayed open 24 hours. We tried breakfasts and lunches in the main dining rooms at breakfast & lunch on this cruise and were not disappointed. Sit down meals with service. No crowds. Quiet. And, great choices & food. I would suggest others to try this option. The Deluxe Drink Package was well worth the cost. We were able to have all our drinks paid for up front and no costs at the end of the cruise. We could have juices, sodas, cocktails, and water during our whole trip at any time.We booked 3 excursions with RCI (Skagway) & one private excursion (Juneau) and were very pleased with the services. They were very organized. We also booked some ship tours & events. Notes follow:	Juneau – we did a private whale watching excursion here. Were very pleased as we were a smaller group. The RCI excursion had a large boat with a lot of people on it. Very crowded. Glad we went with a private company.	Skagway – we did the White Pass Train & Yukon Suspension Bridge excursion. What an amazing tour. Great guide – John. Lots of photo opportunities. Beautiful scenery up the mountain & back down from Fraser, Canada. One of our daughters & her husband did the Ocean Raft adventure and loved it. Lots of wildlife and scenery. They were very pleased. Our other daughter did the glass blowing tour and it was amazing. It was a small group (6) and a very hands-on experience.  	Dawes Glacier – our ship went right into the canal all the way to Dawes Glacier. It was absolutely stunning! For this, we booked the North Star for Glacier morning. Well worth the premium cost. The ship is in the Glacier from 7:30 – 8:30 AM and that is prime time to see it. We had an 8 AM reservation and it was amazing. Great photos. The North Star vessel goes up & out to the sides of the ship, so you get all perspectives & angles of the glacier and in the canal. You really must watch your online reservations to book this, as it fills up fast.  We also booked a glacier helipad photo shoot on this morning, after the North Star. Great choice. Able to see the glacier from the top. No crowds. Great photo shoot & photo opportunity. You must book this when you get on ship, embarkation day, as it fills up fast. We were not disappointed. 	Victoria, BC – we just did our own walking tour of town. It was great. Very beautiful and easy to explore. The city is so lush, cool, and beautiful. The people were so friendly to talk with. We only had one negative here and that was that the shuttles & taxis to the center of Victoria, BC were very expensive. It was cheaper to walk the two miles in & around. Also, it was hard to find restrooms in Victoria, BC for the tourists. So, if you visit any restaurants, go be for you leave! 	All Access Ship Tour – we booked this way in advance and were enthralled with the experience. We got to see the ship from the inside out and everything that goes into it’s sailing. Great tour! NOTE: Long pants and closed toe shoes are required for everyone on the tour. There were a variety of shows and entertainment for all ages. Lots of musical productions. Pixels was the highlighted show on the ship and required reservations. It was great! Lots of music & and singing. Make reservations early & preferably prior to sailing. Best show was the Headliner Show starring Vocal Group Private Stock. Absolutely great! There are not as many daytime activities to choose from in the Cruise Compass each day. They were repetitive, most days. The morning consisted of workout activities and a few excursion talks. Some shopping events. The afternoons consisted of a few game shows and trivia. Also, BINGO was only offered 4 times and only on sea days – Day 2, 9 AM & 2:15 PM, Day 5 3:45 PM, Day 6 10:30 AM. And, the lines to get cards scaled from one end of the ship to another each time. Very long lines! Disappointed in this process.We wished some of the shows had an earlier time. There were either at the early dinner time or the late dinner time, or late at night, after 10 PM. More afternoon show options would have been great on some days. The casino was a great place to have lose your money. The men in our group loved attempting to win, but they didn’t have any luck. It was a good way for Royal Caribbean to take our money. But it was fun.Overall, we had an amazing cruise. This was our 4th cruise on Royal Caribbean and we were extremely pleased.

It's a large ship with approx. 4000 guest. The buffet restaurant and dining room were clean and service was good but the food was just okay. We were excited about the iFly on board but that was already booked up weeks before ship set sail. The Pixel show was the only reservation we were able to get. I did not enjoy the show but maybe it wasnt my my thing. Our cruise was supposed to go to the Endicott Arm and Dawes Glacier but the ship was too large to make it through the passage. We were told the reason was the ice was too thick although I don't think this large ship would ever be able to make it through the channel to the glacier. I liked our stateroom and service was great. Overall the ship was nice but I was not overly impressed with any of it.,Sail Date: July 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Family (older kids)|Destination: Alaska|,

Most of the crew was fabulous.  Customer service from the upper management was completely lacking.  I was put into a balcony cabin just above the smoking area of the ship.  When I read reviews that it was awful I requested a change. I talked to one customer service rep after another and finally got the head of their complaint dept. He assured me no one had ever complained about the cabin - but when we were on the ship we learned that was not the case - that there were always complaints about it. We wasted our first evening there standing in line to complain, and were eventually told we could have another room - which meant another hour of repacking what I had unpacked and moving everything ourselves down the hall.  They also lost my sister's luggage and Keith Murphy, the Hotel Director on the ship, was almost antagonistic toward my sister.  For the first two days they asked if one of her family members might have it - did she leave it at the hotel, or the trunk of her car?  When she took offence to this because she had 8 other people in our party who SAW her husband load it onto the luggage cart designated for Royal Caribbean.  This piece of luggage held all her jewelry, a CPAP machine, an iPad, and all their clothes, binoculars, umbrellas - and completely disappeared,  Not once was she given an apology - immediately Keith Murphy went on the defensive and started offering ways SHE might have lost it herself.  Extremely frustrating that they offered nothing in the way of an explanation - they did give her binoculars and umbrellas - but beyond that they could offer nothing - and acted as if she should stop bothering them.  I chose Ovation of the Seas because we loved the sister ship Anthem of the Seas.  In particular, this ship does not work for Alaska - first you cannot go to Ketchikan - it is too big - so you get to go to Juneau and Skagway and finally instead of Ketchikan we spend a day in Victoria, British Columbia.  It sucks.  The highlight of the trip was spending time in the Endicott Arms and Dawes Glacier - you cruise right into this area and get to view it from the ship from 7 to 12 Noon.  We sailed almost to this destination, and then were told our ship was too big to go into the river to see it!!  The icebergs in the area were too large and our ship was too large to avoid them - so canceled!!  It truly is the high point of this trip and we could not do it.  The smaller ships could, but not us.  I do not recommend this ship to anyone who wants to see Alaska.  And I hope you do not have to deal with the upper management - especially Keith Murphy in charge of the cabins  - they really do not offer any help and if you have to save to go on a vacation to Alaska - you should go on a ship that can actually see ALASKA, and where expectations should be no surprises once you are on.  We had a miserable trip due to upper management on this ship, and the fact that you miss 50% of the itinerary by choosing  Ovation of the Seas.",Sail Date: July 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Family (multi-generational)|Destination: Alaska|,"Washington, DC"

My family chose the Ovation as it was a new ship and had plenty of activities for my two young nephews (11 and 13).  It was an extremely tacky ship and it did not look new.  Clearly no interior designers had been employed.  The food was terrible, breakfast was okay but the dinners were abysmal.  This cruise was fairly expensive and I absolutely expected better.  The staff and service were very pleasant, however.  To make matters worse, I discovered a white rubber balloon or something worse in a water bottle that I had been given from one of the bars on board, and not until I had consumed two thirds of the water.  The brand was Ice River Springs.  Also, everything on board seemed to be a money grab, staff trying to sell you drink packages, spa packages etc.  Soft drinks were not included in the price of the cruise for example.  There were constant ""sidewalk"" sales of tacky watches etc. in the shopping areas and a persistent push to buy family photos.  Altogether very off-putting.  I have been on two other cruises in the Mediterranean on Holland America and they were far superior.  I was sadly mistaken when I chose Royal Caribbean for this holiday.",Sail Date: July 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Family (older kids)|Destination: Alaska|,

I dont want to say to big, because I chose this ship because it was large with lots to do. I knew we would have lots of time at sea and i wanted options. Unfortunately , they were all full all of the time.  Here are the ups and downs.Staterooms- LOVELY! Not too small, nice, and our balcony was AMAZING. Do not book this trip if you cannot get the balcony. Just wait until you can. We saw dolphins, whales, and seals. Plus the ocean is just beautiful. Kept clean. Dont expect anything fun or extra even if you tip well like you get other places. Elevators and walkways- Always full to bursting on the main decks where the restaurants and shops are. You cannot hardly get your wallet out you are so crowded when shopping. Forget the sales unless you love black friday crowds. Restaurants (free ones)- The buffet is awful. People are running around everywhere , its chaos. Bumping into each other and cutting in front of others. If you actually get a plate of food without it being knocked to the ground , good luck finding a seat. Its always full. They were actually making announcements to please leave once you have eaten to allow others to sit.  The sit down restaurant is a better atmosphere. The service is excellent. The food is terrible. We gave up and ate at the pizza place most days. This is a great quick option. They have vegetarian and pepperoni.  Restaurants (pay for ones) - I couldn't tell you because they were all booked before we even got on board. All of them. For lunch and dinner. Do get the drink package! Its worth it! If you get the deluxe, it includes bottled water, fresh juices, cappucinos, sparkling water, and your alcoholic beverages! You will want this! I will say , its not the size of the ship that is the problem. There was a ton of room all the time on the viewing decks both inside and out. Lots of room in the theatres for shows. Its just the main decks 4 and 5 that are ridiculous. And the buffet seating. Maybe my time dining isnt a great idea and they should schedule it so this doesnt happen.I want to say the staff is WONDERFUL! The bartenders are excellent. They are friendly, fun, and make great drinks. The activity staff is great! So funny and the activities are very organized and plentiful. There is always something going on! Its just probably full. The Shows are all oustanding! Dont miss! Get there at least 30 min early if you want a seatNOTE- The ports are everything you hope they are. Perfect . You must see Alaska! Shout outs to Joff , Angelle, (Cruise Director, Activity Manager) They made me laugh everyday!!! Crispin, Maxamillion (one in a million), Stace, (Schooner Bar) and Igor (Vintages)  They made this trip for us. OH, and Paul O'Shea! I seriously dont know what we would have done at night without the piano bar fun! Bottom Line- Do go to Alaska!

The Tours in Alaska, are very expensive, so  be prepared to spend a lot of money If you really want to live Alaska.  It is better to book the Tours in advance or at least the first moment you get into the boat, otherwise they will be fully booked.The service was average, on the first day, my family baggage took several hours to get into our room, I am talking about 6 hours, considering we got into our room about 12:00 and finally the last of 4 bags was delivered at 8:00 PM, I had to go to the lower deck to ask for my bag because we wanted to got for dinner but my son's clothes were missing after talking with several people the bag was found somewhere. The Rooms with balcony are better to look beautiful views from the mountains, the waterfalls from the snow melting. The food, was very good, there were several buffets for breakfast, the main one was the Windjammer on the 14th floor.The A la carte Restaurants were for dinner with previous reservations, I highly recomend Chops (Steak), and Wonderland, and of course the  service was excellent.   Sidney was our favorite waiter, he gave us good tips on wines, meals and did some handcrafts for my youngest son.   He also worked as a Superviser at the Breakfast Buffet.The Ship has different activities for all ages,  like the Climbing Rock, The Arcade Room, The Multiple Course (Basketball, Soccer, Acrobats)  The Bumper Cars, The Wind tunnel for skydiving, Casino  and the Flow Rider to do surfing.There was also a Kid's Club for children up to 12 years old, the entrance was free, but if the kid's stay later than 10:00 PM there is an extra fee.It was very relaxing to seat on the deck, and watch different animals like whales, sea lions or dolphins swimming next to the Cruise at any time.About the Yewelry Store On board........the last night of the Tour my wife bought a Tanzanite  Bracelet for $ 350 USD with 35 stones, and the Certificate of Authenticity said it was made of 38 stones, we presented a claim to Bruna, a brazilian attendat at the Store, she was very polite, but didn't do anything to clarify it, so we left the boat with the feeling it was a scam, because they can still make a pair of earrings with those 3 missings stones.  So if you decied to buy a jewel, make sure to verify it very carefully, or buy the first days of the cruise.The Tours I recommend are: The Tour to the glacier, flying in a helicopter and the Dog Sledding, The White Pass Train in Skagway and the Whale watching  Tour in Juneau.I took this Cruise in May and still had to wear a light jacket sometimes, but if you go to Alaska between June and August, you will find tempertures during the day around 76 °F  or 25 °C, and maybe you will not see too much snow due to the melting from the summer, unless you take a tour to the Glacier on a high elevtion.

Our embarkation process was amazing quick to get on board, probably the fastest we had ever experienced in our 14 cruises.  Our balcony cabin was on the 13th floor, and that is just one floor below the Windjammer buffet restaurant.  We heard no noise from the Windjammer in our cabin.  And it was so easy to go up one flight of stairs, and not wait for the elevator to go up and get a snack, breakfast, or a cup of coffee.  The Windjammer is often so full for the morning breakfasts that looking for an open table can be challenging.  However, even though there were about 5800 passengers on this cruise, we never felt that the rest of the ship was that crowded.  We decided to go with My Time Dining, and our waits to get seated in one of the dining rooms was never more than 5 minutes or so.  Sometimes there was no wait at all -- our times were at our preferences from 7 to 7:45 pm, depending upon our day's activities.  The menu choices were excellent -- and the food quality matched that excellence.  I would say that there is no need to choose the speciality restaurants, but Chops is an excellent steakhouse.  Royal Caribbean Cruise Line (RCCL), compared to other cruise lines such as Disney, does tend to nickle-and-dime you with extra charges.  For example, no lanyard is given to you with your Sea Pass Card, but you can buy one on the ship for $8.  Also if you want soft drinks, that is an extra charge. If you want a cup of coffee to go in a disposable cup, you can only do this at one of the coffee stands and pay a fee for your coffee in a disposable cup.  But in other places the coffee is no charge, but you have to use a regular china coffee cup.  RCCL should improve its in-room TV channels.  We do not spend a lot of time in our cabin on cruises, but we found that the limited TV channels were of almost no interest to us.  Would have been nice to have better options when we were in our stateroom.  We had three ports of call, and did excursions on each one.  They were all great, and the choices for the Alaska cruise on RCCL are plentiful, and our excursions really allowed us to enjoy the scenic beauty of Alaska.  On our whale watching excursion, we were able to view a family of Orcas (killer whales) and a Humpback Whale and her calf.  Also our Best of Skagway excursion included a train ride on the White Pass Railroad and that had great scenery also.  We would certainly recommend RCCL and Ovation of the Seas for an Alaskan Cruise.  Before our cruise, we came to Seattle a couple of days early, and went to the Space Needle, Chihuly Glass & Gardens, the Museum of Pop Culture, and other attractions.  There are many nice shops on the ship with many jewelry and watch products.  As you get along in the cruise, some of the watches are discounted up to 75% on the last 2 days of the cruise.  We found the entertainment on Ovation of the Seas to be excellent, but not outstanding.  Some nights we elected not to go to a show because the type of show was not of interest to us; and that's very unique to anyone's interests or preferences.Our debarkation process was very smooth and no problems or delays in getting off the ship.  All in all, overall, a wonderful experience and I would recommend the Ovation of the Seas.",Sail Date: June 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Alaska|,"Winter Park, Florida"

The Alaska cruise we took in June 2019 was great, even if this was our 4th Alaskan cruise.The experience boarding the ship and the end of cruise disembarkation were by far the smoothest we have ever experienced in 16 cruises. Once in the port building, you hardly ever stopped moving; check-in was seamless and without any bobbles. Disembarkation was even better. RCCL provided a no-charge service wherein baggage that you'd normally have to claim dockside was taken directly from the ship to the airport and checked for you; we didn't have to deal with any bags from final packing until we arrived home. What a wonderful, unadvertised perk!The upscale restaurants onboard are absolutely first-class. I particularly recommend Chops and Jamie's Italian. The food is superb; the service top-notch. And for an exquisitely fun experience, go to Wonderland, where they take you ""down the Rabbit Hole"" and deliver extremely creative and wonderful food. The only negative is the fixed menu in each restaurant. Admittedly there is plenty from which to choose, but the menu for the restaurants doesn't vary from day-to-day.While the overall experience was fantastic, little things took away from this being the ""perfect"" cruise. Let's start with the Dining package. We bought the Ultimate Dining package, giving us access to all the upscale dining experiences (Chops, Jamie's Italian, Wonderland, others), but after spending the extra dollars for this, we could not pre-book our dining times; all reservations had to be made AFTER we boarded the ship, meaning that despite having paid a premium, we were pushed to the back of the line for bookings. Even after booking the meals, we never received a printout nor any reminders about them; they did not show up on our booked activities list! If I had not written down every booking myself, we might have missed one which would have resulted in a missed booking penalty of $10 to $25.RCCL boasted about their on-board Royal IQ app aboard the Ovation of the Seas which was to provide an on-board connection to activities and your shipboard account without buying the VOOM internet package (which is outrageously expensive). However, the app never worked because the specified wi-fi network for it didn't exist. The only available wi-fi network onboard was Ovation Guest, and that was ONLY for VOOM internet customers. Those who bought the VOOM package raved about the connection and available information; those of us who couldn't afford it had to refer to Royal IQ machines, in-cabin TV, or the printed Compass.The staff in the Grande dining room and meals there were mediocre throughout the week. Seating was messed up, orders were confused, service was slow -- until the very last evening when things finally met the expected standards. But 6 nights too late.The North Star observation pod required advance reservations, which weren't made available, nor was this information communicated. The daily Compass always carried a time frame when reservations were not required, but even then, it was previously booked up. My wife did manage to get in because of a no-show, but that was pure luck.Even with these shortfalls, we had a marvelous trip. We have been with at least 4 other cruise lines on about 16 cruises, so we have come to expect certain things. RCCL needs to work on some things, but none of the little things were big enough to prevent us from booking another RCCL cruise next year in May 2020!",Sail Date: June 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Alaska|,"Houston, Texas"

Service was top notch. Not going to lie, with 3 of us in an inside cabin it was crowded. But we didn't spend much time in the room anyway. There was far too much going on to keep us busy. Bumper cars were a ""hit"" with us. I must say we took no mercy on the folks that just wanted to go in a big circle. They'er called bumper cars for a reason. Another fun time was had in the I fly. I mean who doesn't want to ski dive. I roller skated but with a 40 yr. gap in skating I decided best not to tempt fame a go for more than once around. If the wheels were tighter I think I could have done better. The N. star was ok. Would have been really fun on a glacier day but was booked for private parties those days. The Pools are awesome. Just the right temp. Hot tub come in a various temps. Check around for the one that suits you. Finding lounge chairs for more that one person can be difficult as people tend to claim there spot and hold onto it by leaving stuff on them. The cruise line does ask that you don't do it. BUT!  NOW about the food. Off the charts fantastic! The grand dinning is the way to go. Excellent service with every need attended to. If you don't care for what you ordered no problem.

They have a ""Fun Zone"" offering Bumper Cars, Roller Skating, Basket Ball at different times. There is an XBOX area, Giant Chess, and more fun things that kids can enjoy. Our room was an inside room with a virtual balcony and it was just perfect! The room steward cleans the rooms 2xper day unless you ask otherwise. They leave cute ""Towel Critters"" made in your room off and on, are there for you 24/7 and are very friendly. I took my heating pad for my shoulder issues but wasn't able to use it - when I plugged it in, it just blinked constantly. The shower is roomy and nice, plenty of hot water, but it fluctuates a lot. Bed was comfy but also hard. We asked for extra pillows and that wasn't an issue.Food: We primarily ate at the Windjammer ""Buffet"" style eating. The first couple of days the breakfast was great! But as the trip went on, the scrambled eggs got watery and mushy - It's pretty much the same food every day in the Windjammer, but at least you know what your getting. We did eat in a couple of the other restaurants on deck 3. The first night it was great food, quick service - the second night was VERY slow service, and our table and neighboring table had issues with orders being incorrect. Bars: Our favorite bar was the Amber & Oak on deck 4. We had some great bartenders who knew how to mix a drink! And gave us lot's of laughs. The Schooner Bar on deck 5 was nice, we would go there for Trivia time. We also went to Two70 and enjoyed drinks, looking out of the back of the ship, listening to the band and watching dance lessons. ""Go Mike!""They are very much about pushing the ""Jewelry"" sales on and off the ship, so they give talks and ""free"" gifts if you want to sit through it.The cruise was smooth sailing all but one day - it got a bit rough and a lot of people didn't feel well, but then by the evening it calmed down.

This was to be our senior citizen bucket list trip of a life time and it was ruined by a boat. The cabin # 3596 was right on top of the crew quarters and the place where the crew works on the engine. The first night it was so loud we had to stay up all night. Banging and thumping and dragging stuff over the ground. It was impossible to sleep. The second night it was someone banging with a hammer. bang bang bang bang band, after an hour I call the front and a crew man came at midnight and did absolutely nothing. no sleep that night either. The 3rd day we got off ship and bought ear plugs. The ship couldn't move us because it was full. The banging so so loud it actually came through even with ear plugs. $5,000 down the crapper.Then there was the food. This is what we go on cruises for but man it is disappointing on this one. The desserts are so bad you just don't eat them. You think it would be sweet but nope. The desserts  have been revamped they are now sugarless, fat free, gluton free and tasteless. The beef stroganoff had pickles and beets in it????? What is that about. Breakfast was good but the rest nope.............not cruise ship worthy. The menu they give you makes it look like there's always food but that is not the fact. You eat during their 2 to 3 hours that the resturants are open and there's only pizza and pastries when they are not. The other cruises always have food but not this one. There was crying babies all over that were hungry. One guy got so mad he stood in the middle of the ship and screamed "" is there nothing to eat on the ship besides pizza""The crew is so unfriendly. They are not helpful. they have such forced smiles it's unreal. The only good thing about this cruise was the stateroom attendants. They are good.

However, several of our fellow cruisers acted like they were going to starve if they didn't get their plates filled to the brim as quickly as possible. They would cut in line and be very rude to both the passengers and the staff. This behavior is unacceptable and brings down the more respectful guests.

The Royal Loft for ourselves and two family suites for our sons, wife and 5 grandchildren ranging in age from 5 years of age to seventeen.  This is our second cruise on this ship and the best yet because we wanted to share something special with the family this time, so they would share a life long happy memory of the occasion.To achieve this, we had the 'complete package' for the cruise including a 'Royal Genie' who was provided by Caribbean to attend to out every whim and our Genie Luciano Santos, went out of his way to do just that.  Luciano couldn't have been more perfect.  Theatre seats booked, priority queing for anything we wanted to do or go to, cocktails on tap and full on happy time every day. Quite frankly we didn't care where the ship went as life aboard was great.   What a cruise, all 11 of us in our party had a ball.  Caribbean provided every age level with things to do and keep everyone amused and entertained and I must admit, priority queing for the bumper cars was great. With unlimited restaurant selection, drinks and internet packages and 'our' Genie on call 24/7, included in the 'Royal Suite' booking for both our sons and ourselves, we couldn't have wished for more and was well worth having.Having cruised several times on both Caribbean and Princess cruises, Caribbean is certainly far more family orientated with much more provided to entertain children of any age.  Our seventeen year old granddaughter quickly met and formed around 12 new friends in her age group and because of American law restrictions on the drinking age on board, those under 21 were not able to have alcohol, so night clubbing into the early hours for her was of no concern.Thank you Caribbean.

We enjoyed the comfort of a 2 bedroom (2 bathroom) suite Room 9634, located on level nine in the centre of the ship.  These cabins have the largest balconies on the whole ship and I can highly recommend them.  Not only for size and comfort but also fo the privileges that come with them.  Private sun baking area for suite guests, private dining 'full service' (Coastal Kitchen), concierge lounge access 24/7 with complimentry drinks and snacks from 4.30pm - 8pm daily and more.  This cruise coincided with school holidays, which saw 4900 guests onboard serviced by 1600+ crew.  A lot of people right! Yes the lifts were busy at times, as were the activities, however it all seemed to work out and the stairs were an option we used 'a lot', for some exercise to work off some of the food.  Activity wise, there is something for everyone 24/7 on this shop and some highlights for us were the wave rider, iFly and North Star.  The evening entertainment shows were also first class.  I can highly recommend this ship and the outstanding offer of activities onboard, with staff ""that were genuinely there to pleas and importantly look after you"".  They produce 40,000 meals a day on this ship, and given the sheer volume the food provided it is VERY good.  Not excellent, however I have no complaints and 9.5 out of 10 people would be happy. Would I do it again?  YES!  In a flash.  Thanks Royal Caribbean you rock!PS... One day there was 40 knots of wind and 2-3metre seas.

When I booked, I felt that 43 nights on a ship would be more than enough.  In retrospect I'm sorry I wasn't braver when I booked.Checking-in was horrendous.  It took well over 2 hours of standing in a slow-moving queue at Tilbury and would have been much worse had it not been for the interesting people I chatted to whilst creeping forward.  By the time I arrived at my cabin my back was killing me, and my suitcase was nowhere to be seen.The cabin was a very pleasant surprise - spacious, clean, comfortable.  Fridge, TV, telephone, writing desk, en-suite, plenty of storage, armchair.  Unrestricted view on the port side, midships Deck 10.  Marvellous!  (And my luggage turned up within the hour.)The food in both the Bistro and the restaurant was plentiful and with a good, varied choice.  On the nights I didn't want anything fancy from the main course menu I just had grilled salmon with chips - absolutely delicious.  Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff on board in the bars or the restaurants.  And although language was an issue occasionally, the cheerful multi-cultural vibe emanating from the staff reminded me what travel is all about.The entertainments team was superb with an enormous variety of tastes and genres catered for.  Even now I cannot believe that 3 people delivered 'Phantom of the Opera' professionally enough to reduce me to tears.  There was something on the packed itinerary every day to suit all.Our trip was beset by problems which showed the calibre of the staff   ........  A Force 12 storm in the Atlantic meant we missed The Azores.  Before, and during, this storm the Captain kept us all informed (which gave me the opportunity to take some tablets that saw me sleep through most of it!) and reassured us constantly.  Despite crockery and glassware crashing to the floor, and the Bistro having to be shut, the staff kept smiling and working hard despite many of them looking a little green at the gills themselves.  The medical centre was overrun with passengers needing cannulas inserted and IV drips, and wounds stitched.  But, throughout it all, there was no questioning the care, support, and concern offered by the ship's crew.After the storm, a stomach virus on board sent 150 people into quarantine.  This created massive cleaning/disinfecting problems for the crew which was carried out throughout many long nights by staff in haz-chem gear.  The pools, jacuzzis, and laundries were shut, some classes and activities cancelled, and access to all self-service areas was restricted.  This was all done with the safety and well-being of passengers and crew at the forefront of the management's decisions.The coronavirus outbreak In China resulted in frustrating changes to the ship's itinerary.    Although many passengers were naturally disappointed, the changes were made sensibly and with the excursion team working their socks off to arrange new schedules.  A measles outbreak in Tonga, coupled with their concern over cruise ships carrying infection, meant another last-minute diversion as the authorities turned all cruise ships away.  Another logistical nightmare for the crew to deal with.Despite the motion sickness I have been on other cruise ships.  And yes, they were more luxurious.  The Columbus isn't the most upmarket, sleek, modern ship you can travel on - but you get what you pay for folks!  And for the 43 nights I was on board, I had excellent value for money,  More importantly, especially as a solo traveller, I felt safe, cared for and valued throughout.",Sail Date: January 2020|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: |Destination: Australia|,"Portishead, United Kingdom"

However, the seating is very limited and trying to get a table at busy times is challenging. Also opening times are too short, especially on sea days, when passengers are expected to eat their meals in a short period.The main dining room is very good, there are no tables for two, but we were lucky in we managed to have a table for four to ourselves. I know for many people sharing a dining table is their idea of heaven, for me it’s the opposite I don’t want to eat with strangers. I appreciate it is a question of space but I do wish cruise lines would make more tables for two available.The vast majority of the food was excellent quality and the quantity was good as well, you didn’t come away from dinner feeling you could eat some more, which does happen with some cruise lines. Service was good with friendly staff.Talking of staff, like most cruise lines the staff were very multinational – unfortunately a large number did not have a very good command of English. They spoke enough to do their jobs adequately but if you wanted to chat to find out a bit more about the individual then most of the conversations went over their heads.Getting food late in the evening was very difficult – they do advertise a snack service in the lounges between 23:00 and 23:30 but finding this service was like looking for hen’s teeth and when you did find it they had invariably run out of what was being offered.Now we are not great drinkers however we like an occasional tipple. On the plus side bar prices were very reasonable and certainly a lot cheaper than many cruise lines.There was a good choice of wines at dinner.Service in the bars was variable. One evening we went to Raffels and it was very quiet but we walked out after 15 minutes without being served as the waitress was more interested in chatting up the barman and joking with him than serving customers.When we went to another bar the drinks were disappointing - a gin and tonic was served in a half pint beer glass whilst the Singapore Sling tasted like no other Singapore Sling I have drunk before - and I don't mean that in a positive way.The entertainment was, how shall I put it, interesting. The shows in the main theatre weren’t exactly bad but they were not brilliant either – they seemed more like enthusiastic amateurs than professionals. Certainly not as slick as shows on other cruise lines.Costumes looked home-made, the choreography limited and the sound system was appalling, with the music often drowning out the vocals, not helped by some of the performers having weak voices. The only decent show on the main stage was the rat pack tribute and even then the three performers seemed more interested in making in jokes.Ironically the best show of the cruise wasn’t in the main theatre but was a Jersey Boy tribute in the Atrium one evening.The outside facilities on this cruise were irrelevant as the weather was appalling. One of the swimming pools has seating beside a bar – which would be cool on a balmy summers day.Our visit to Amsterdam was cancelled due to bad weather and we were kept informed and updated by the Captain. Amazingly there was a passenger in the buffet who was mouthing off about how disgraceful it was Amsterdam had been cancelled – some people have no concept of safety.The crew were also able to get port cancellation confirmation letters ready within 24 hours, so we could claim on our travel insurance.There are plenty of quiet nooks and crannies on board with the Library being a great place to sink into a comfortable sofa or chair with a book. The games room was also popular with a good selection of games and jigsaws.As an older ship her design is more traditional and streamlined, which proved to be a great advantage as the ship was incredibly stable, even in the force 9 winds in the North Sea, with minimal pitching or rolling.This was our first experience sailing with CMV, there are better cruise lines around but there also many worse.I like Columbus and her size and would certainly sail on her again in future.",Sail Date: December 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: |Destination: Europe|,"Milton Keynes, United Kingdom"

Boyle Photography)|Dec 2019,/Profile/DanHBoyle,30,Lacking,"So I shall start this review by saying we did not go on a cruise but did an overnight dinner, show and breakfast in the port of Tilbury, Essex.From 2005-2009, I used to work on cruise ships (NCL now NCLA) so know what to expect to a certain degree and for me, this ship was lacking. Now, I know this ship is older and in fairness it was reasonably clean considering the amount of passengers it has seen and the years of service. First impressions therefore was that this ship was quaint and given the crew/passenger ratio of 2:1 you can get the impression the focus is on service and that they cater for the more ""mature"" cruisers. That is my impression anyway.So yes, initially we get on board and have a welcome aboard drink which was a nice touch and it was good that they had a selection of drinks and not just some cheap knock off so called ""champange"". The drink went down very well.CABIN: Because we we just staying for one night, we went to the cabin straight away and first impressions were the cabin was pretty decent. It was an inside cabin and it was a lot bigger than inside cabins on other ships so that was a good thing. The linen was clean and the beds were comfortable and there was plenty of storage space but that is kind of where it ended. I briefly touched on the age of the ship and the cabin did show some signs of this. So there should be 4 glass holders in the bathroom but there was only 3 but the holes for the 4th were visible. There were no sanitary towel bags in the bathroom and the carpet hadn't been hoovered very well. In all honesty, because you spend such little time in the cabin it didn't really bother us. However, as I took a shower the handle for the water adjustment fell off and it landed of all places on my toe. This was reported to reception and I also sought medical so the ship had a record of it. The cabin number was 5127. As I said however, the beds were so comfortable and therefore I slept very well and given the fact it is an inside cabin, you have no concept of time......lovely.DINNER: There were two sittings and we opted for the 1800. The restaurant is called Waterfront and is located on deck 7 aft. It has a friendly feel and it is very much like any other ""main"" restaurant you would get on a cruise ship i.e. no real surprises. Our group of 6 had 3 vegetarians (ALL dislike mushroom), 1 vegan and 2 meat eaters and yet we found the menu was lacking in choice (as shown in the photograph). What got us was that the Beef Consomme was marked down as suitable for vegetarians. Now I know cows eat grass but that is as vegetarian as it gets. Overall, the lack of choice and quality off food was not as good as we all expected. However, because we were in good company, it didn't;t really put a dampener on the meal.ENTERTAINMENT: I have to say the Panto which was the Wizard of Oz but the highlight of the evening. I mean I really do not like pantos but this was so bad that it was good and you had to keep watching. From forgotten lines, to a really slow Toto to ""Rubber Balls"" it was actually highly entertaining. I mean I will never win any awards but pretty much the whole audience was laughing. DJ Brad who played Glinda the ""Good"" Witch has some balls to do what he did (anyone who saw the show will know what I mean). The Scottish girl who played Dorothy was a great sport and she played the role very well also.PRICES: Actually, this surprised us the most. The cost of beer, wine, cocktails and spirits were pretty good considering you are on a ship. A cocktail was 5.70GBP which I don't think it too bad. Beers were around 3-4GBP and a coke was 2GBP I think and this is very good considering some cruise lines can charge 7-8USD per beer. SERVICE: In general this was pretty good. Everyone was friendly and attentive so no real issues.DEBARKATION: Luckily we had settled the bill at 0745 as I needed to go to medical and it was kind of fortunate as when we were due to leave at 0900, the payment system had gone down so no one could debark as the bills hadn't been automatically settled. These things happen of course and I totally get that but the queues around the atrium were something else and there were no staff on hand or even stanchions to allow a better flow. To be fair though, us brits are renowned for knowing how to queue!OVERALL: The ship and food was left wanting but the company I shared made the evening and that was what is was all about. I would like to think I would do an overnight again but couldn't say for certain. Whether I would cruise on this ship is another thing entirely as it will be a completely different experience and not just catering for people who just wanted to get drunk!",Sail Date: December 2019|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: |Destination: Europe|,"Upminster, United Kingdom"

They said it would be decided on the ship which meant I couldnt plan correctly as no other info online regarding 3 night cruise.Gratuities are £7 per person per night which seems excessive based on the limited amount we actually spent per evening.Day of disembarking you have to be out of your room at 7am. This could mean you are without a room for up to 4 hours depending on your location on the ship. Also your ship card is no longer active and they dont accept debit/credit cards in the cafes so you need Sterling.PositivesFood was excellent in the main restaurants and I couldnt fault any of it whatsoever. Buffet similarly good though as youd expect with a buffet the quality is much better at the start of service than towards the end.Wine was £15+ a bottle. Beer averaged £3 for a 330ml can. Or a large beer £3.60 which was 400ml.Can of coke £2.20 and coffee was around £1.60.The crossing was choppy due to wind but generally felt very little motion. Staff were friendly but they had an obsession with forcing you in with others in a morning when you just want to sit on your own. This caused a lot of frustration to people we sat with which made it very awkward. One female passenger refused to be sat with others which was very awkward to have to listen to when the member of staff kept challenging her.Overall would highly recommend but feel cruise and maritime could do more to help someone who hasn't done a cruise know more of the finer detail as to what they should expect.,Sail Date: December 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Europe|,"Rotherham, United Kingdom"

Not a good start when the ship had been delayed due to bad weather and we were late leaving (this couldn't be helped)  We were advised once on board that due to this we would no longer be going to Antwerp as we would not have enough time.  Fair enough we still had the other 2 ports.  Amsterdam which we did not know until we got there does not have christmas markets any more but was enjoyable and from where we docked about a 10 minute walk to town.  Hamburg had 3 christmas markets so made up for it though they were very busy.  We have been on several cruises and different cruise lines and this was the first with CMV and it will be our last.  The staff were rude, unhelpful and the protocol was non existent.  The food in the main restaurant was good, we didn't really eat in the buffet as it was always full and just to packed to bother with, the 1 day we did eat there though we watched with horror as the few waiters that were about just walked past tables that needed clearing.

I worked as a member of the cruise staff for 10 years on Cunard cruises many years ago and I got to be a passenger on QE2 10 years later which was an eye opener. When my girlfriend wanted to try out cruising we went on Marco Polo for an over night (sister ship to Columbus) and was stunned by what they had to offer for such a cheap price. It really gave little away to the Cunard cruises I used to be involved in. The entertainment was good and the cruise director did everything he could to show off what they had to offer. The ship was strangely 6 hours late on this occasion to return to port in UK but they put on lots of entertainment to keep passengers entertained.Wind forward to December 19 and we are the much larger Columbus to Antwerp. The ship isn't so friendly or personal but this is to be expected with the extra size. Like the Marco Polo it is beautifully done out. Being winter time passengers don't go out on the open decks so much and everyone dines inside. With a full capacity of 1400 passengers and only 630 crew to help this simply didn't work. We found the whole experience extremely claustrophobic. The layout of the buffet areas meant regular collisions between passengers. You were constantly surrounded by people with little opportunity to sit anywhere and dine. When we could eat and not freeze there were no complaints about the food. Our cabin was lovely and we enjoyed the spa (which was empty). Although the overcrowding was unavoidable most of the time, it was clear more could have been done to solve the issue. There was no publicity about the a la carte restaurant which apparently serves open sitting at breakfast time and lunch time. In order to avoid the crush at the buffet (even though we were in port) we thought we'd try lunch there. We were greeted by a receiving line of 5 waiters (who would have been useful in the buffet restaurant) only to notice that even though the restaurant was huge, the few people there were crushed together on 3 tables. We asked for our own table and found ourselves sat down at the next table. Minutes later another couple were squeezed in next to us. The lady was virtually sitting on my lap and had a terrible cold. I realised that if we didn't want to get sick we had to break free and leave (we also noticed that the menu was the same as the buffet menu. As Cunard used to do this we can assume this is normal but when so many tables were available it became apparent then that this was a sheepherding exercise and there was no interest in the passenger's experience) The first strange occurrence was the decision to move the ship whilst in port. The Christmas market did not open until midday and they decided to turn the ship round between 2-4.30 in the afternoon blaming the tide for the reason. I have never noticed such a thing in all my years of cruising. It was certainly strange being ashore with a noticeable absence of cruise ship for a very long time. When they did return they had a problem with the gangway and many passengers had to wait in the dock area for 30 minutes before they solved it. Having got people back on board the captain announced that they were not going to be able to sail until 2 am the next morning and everyone could go ashore again.The delay meant that the ship did not arrive in port until 4pm; 8 hours later than planned. I thought the extension would mean a festive atmosphere onboard but incredibly the only entertainment on the last day was a showing of the lion king at 10am when most passengers were making the most of their cabins. There were no cruise staff to be seen, no activities, no announcements, not even any music on in any of the lounges. It was like the whole ships staff had given up on the cruise and couldn't wait to get us off. It was clear all the passengers were bored, fed up and couldn't get off soon enough. In short we enjoyed ourselves but the overcrowding and disinterest of the cruise director and poor entertainment choices meant that this was a missed opportunity. I'm not sure if we will sail again with this particular cruise line and from what we experienced they probably don't care.",Sail Date: December 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: |Destination: Europe|,"Southend-on-Sea, United Kingdom"

It didn't get off to the best start due to a delay in the ship's arrival at Tilbury, which caused problems boarding but cannot blame the company for the weather. I was travelling with a group of friends and sharing a cabin with one. First minor hitch was that although I had specifically booked a twin room(we are not a couple) there was a double bed. Remedied by the steward quickly enough, so no harm done. The cabin was OK but tired. Shower head not great and sink appeared to have cracks around it which seemed dirty. Our cabin steward left dirty glasses in the room for 3 days , failed to replace the bottles of water and didn't always top up the small supply of tea, coffee etc.The bars appeared to me to be short of staff, causing long waiting times for drinks.On the plus side the waiting staff and food in the restaurant were very good. Breakfast in the self service buffet was a total scrum, with too many people and not enough seating, meaning we opted to eat in the main restaurant but unless all 6 of us arrived at the same time we were unable to sit together. The staff would not allow us to keep seats for late comers.This cruise was at the cheaper end of the market and I suppose we got what we paid for overall, but that doesn't excuse the lack of basic cleaning requirements in the cabin.",Sail Date: October 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: |Destination: Europe|,"Southampton, England, United Kingdom"

We drove in and a lady directed us to a small queue of cars waiting to drop off their luggage.  That done, we were guided into a parking space and on the shuttle bus within minutes.  We were dropped off at the cruise terminal and made our way through to the departure lounge.  On the way we were given a medical form to complete, make sure you have a pen handy.  Even though we were a bit early our colour was being boarded, this is governed by your cabin location and is the colour of your luggage label.  We were processed really quickly and in our cabin about 15 minutes after arriving in the car park.CabinWe had been given an upgrade from an inside cabin on Deck 5 (5135) to one on Deck 10 (10198).  It was a good size with plenty of storage and a big shower.  There was a free safe, a fridge and tea & coffee making facilities.  There are also towels that you can take to the pools and blankets to take on deck if you want to sit out and watch a movie on the bigscreen.  Only one plug socket so might be worth taking a little multi-plug extension lead.There's a flat screen telly on the wall with quite a few channels, including BBC World News and ITV Choice.  There are also five Movie Channels which show different films everyday, these are listed in the Explorer and are played on a loop so it's hit and miss whether you'll catch one at the beginning.You can order drinks and snacks for your in-cabin mini bar by completing a form but we found them too expensive so didn't bother.  You can also order 'Breakfast in Bed' by filling in a door hanger, it offers a selection of Fresh Danish Pastry, Toast, Jam, Butter & Orange Juice with a choice of Teas & Coffees.  It is a complementary service and we used it on our last sea day.  We were given a huge jug of coffee, two glasses of orange juice with 1 slice of brown toast, 1 slice of white toast, a cinnamon whirl and a sweet roll, butter and jam.There is also a Premium Breakfast available at a charge of £9.95 per tray unless you are in a deluxe cabin or above.  The options are  Fresh Danish Pastry, Toast, Jam, Butter & Orange Juice with a choice of Teas & Coffees. Plus Full English Breakfast, Ham & Cheese Omelette, Eggs Florentine with Hollandaise Sauce, Smoked Salmon & Poached Eggs on Toast, Bacon & Poached Eggs on Toast or Pancakes with Maple Syrup.ExplorerThe Explorer is the ships newspaper and is left in your cabin each evening.  It tells you a bit about the next days port of call, the dress code for that evening, what entertainment is on and where, the weather forecast and opening hours of all the bars and restaurants.EntertainmentWe found the entertainment to be very good, there was always something going on from quizzes to cabarets.  We went to a couple of the shows in The Palladium presented by the Show Team, they work so hard.  There was also a guest comedian, some of his jokes were a bit old but he was good fun.     FoodThe main dining room is called The Waterfront Restaurant and is on Deck 7, this is waiter service, we prefer the buffet option so didn't use it.The buffet restaurant is called Plantation Bistro and is on Deck 12, we certainly didn't go hungry, but didn't find the food to be as good as other cruises we have been on.  They do serve an Afternoon Tea in this restaurant between 3.30pm-4.30pm, we went once but it was so busy we left and didn't bother trying again. There are also 24 hour tea & coffee stations in there. There are two more speciality restaurants that are chargeable, The Grill and Fusion both on Deck 12, we didn't visit them either.There are  two coffee lounges, Hemmingways on Deck 5 and Cappuccinos's on Deck 12, hot drinks from here are chargeable and so are the selection of cakes.However the prices were probably less than you would pay in a high street coffee shop.  A large slice of Victoria Sandwich was £1.90 and a large iced doughnut was 90p.Gelatos (Deck 12) sells really nice ice cream served in a warm waffle cone and costs £1.50 for one scoop, £2.50 for two.  It was lovely and I was only sorry that we only got to go there once.PhotosWe had our photo taken as we embarked and it cost £5.99 which is a lot cheaper than some other cruise lines.  There was an offer to buy both embarkation photos plus the cruise DVD for £14.99.SpaThe Spa and Gym are located on Deck 2, the gym, steam room and sauna are free to use.  The gym opens from 7am-9pm and is quite a good size, we went nearly everyday at various times and it was never overcrowded.  The steam room etc opens at 9am-9pm.  We did use it once and noticed a sign on the door saying after 12.30pm clothing was optional!  Thankfully we were there (in swimming costumes) alone.  There are changing rooms with lockers to put your belongings in and towels so you don't need to take the ones from your cabin.This is also the place to get your treatments, the prices looked very reasonable compared to other cruises.  One offer was: Luxury Aromatherapy Facial, Hot Stone Massage, Eastern Head Massage, Foot & Ankle Massage, all four treatments 90 minutes £106.  I don't think they advertised enough, when we first got onboard we were given a ticket to complete to enter into a raffle for a free treatment.  We filled it in and expected there to be a presentation where they could show you the treatment rooms and draw the raffle but it was never mentioned again!Drinks PackagesWe paid for the CMV Plus drinks package before we went, which included all gratuities and gave us all soft drinks, including non-alcoholic cocktails, water and juices, plus a one free bottle of wine which is delivered to your cabin.  We also got our drinks in the coffee lounges half price, so a hot chocolate and a latte were 90p each.There are  CMV Premium and CMV VIP packages which give you more drink options.StaffOur cabin steward Arifin was a lovely guy, couldn't do enough for us.  Most of the people in the bars were friendly and helpful although there were a couple who would try to avoid serving us if they could.  Trying to get someone to serve you a drink in the Plantation Bistro was virtually impossible.  The Captain did his daily announcements and was very informative.  Iain the Cruise Director was a funny guy.  We also bumped into Carlo the Guest Service Manager and he was very nice and chatty.Ports We did our own thing at each of the ports so don't know what the excursions were like.EidefjordGot up early to see the beautiful views as we sailed in and it was so foggy we couldn't see a thing.  Later on we went out on deck and came face to face with a mountain!  The fog was clearing.  Had a nice walk round the town – quite small but very pretty.Flam which has only 500 inhabitants!  Few shops and restaurants and The Flam Railway which is very popular.Bergen was the biggest place we went to on this cruise, the second biggest city in Norway with 280,000 inhabitants.  Didn't like it as much as the other places.  Had a wander round and tried a traditional Norwegian waffle. There is a small market not too far from where the ship docks.MiscellaneousThere are two hot tubs on the open deck at the back of Deck 8 and we would have liked to use them first thing in the morning, but they always seemed to have netting over them until later in the day.There are a couple of launderettes onboard if needed, I think they cost about £2.We also found a library, internet room and casino but didn't use them.  There are a couple of shops selling CMV branded goods plus duty free alcohol, cigarettes and perfumes.This was a multi-generational cruise so some children onboard.  There were certain areas e.g the open decks on the back on deck 10 which was meant to be an adults only area, but this was ignored by passengers and not enforced by staff.  Neither was the 'no jumping or diving' rule in the pools, I witnessed several youngsters dive bombing around this poor scared looking woman trying to have a swim!DisembarkationThere are two options:Express Disembarkation, only available to passengers with independent onward travel arrangements and means you carry your own luggage off the ship.  If you want to do this you need to complete the tear off strip from the disembarkation information page that is in your Explorer on the day before arrival in the port.Main Disembarkation where you leave your luggage outside your cabin before midnight on the last night and collect it from the terminal.We did the Express Disembarkation, everyone had to be out of their cabin by 7am and Express people were told to wait in Raffles on Deck 6.  We docked about 8am and were off the ship by 8.30am.  We were told we could either walk to the car park or wait for the shuttle bus, it's really only a two minute walk so we decided to do that.  Make sure you take a note of where you park your car as the car park looks a lot different when it is full to when it was virtually empty, but we found our car relatively easily and were on our way home quickly.",Sail Date: July 2019|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: |Destination: Europe|,"Clacton-on-Sea, United Kingdom"

I was happy with a smaller ship as our last cruise was on a very overcrowded Crown Princess. The cabin was fine the kids had the Pullman beds. The food was good, could have been better but it was sufficient for me to put weight on!!! The staff for the most part were good (our waiters at dinner were brilliant). The bar wait staff not so good had to hunt then down for a drink. The ports were spot on but not long enough, only half a day in Stockholm. CMV do put on free shuttles into town which is helpful. The drinks package are not as flexible as other cruises. I do not drink but my husband does but CMV required both of us to purchase the alcohol drinks package. My son is Type 1 and doesn't drink anything but water but still required to have the kids drinks package. I did like the ship, it is more traditional none of the bells and whistles of the big new super cruisers but it was the right size for us to the make the most of the ports we visited.We were late into Tillbury on the final day due to the sea conditions the previous night. We were over four hours late, with no only one bar/food outlet available. This was only taking Pounds (no other currency) so not everyone had access to it. The delay could have been handled better with some additional food/drinks made available during the 4 hours delay.Overall though we had a fabulous time on holiday. I would certainly travel with CMV again.",Sail Date: August 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: Family (older kids)|Destination: Europe|,Liverpool

Couldn’t fault the staff at the port. Ship set off for the Fjords on time and it was a smooth journey. One of our cases went missing but we did eventually find it at the reception. Food good and lots of choice. Cabin clean even though a bit tired looking. Plantation Buffett was always very busy but that’s not uncommon on cruises. Also people were not always asked to use the antibacterial gel when entering the restaurant and some didn’t bother at all. First problem we encountered was a couple of lifts were out of order. I am a disabled passenger and use a mobility scooter to get around. We had to wait around at the lifts as they were full most of the time. A member of staff told us they were cleaning the lifts but one lift was out of use for at least 2 days. Another problem I had using my mobility scooter was that areas of the ship were not accessible because of high thresholds especially when trying to go outside on to the decks. The corridors were very narrow especially when the cleaning carts were outside the cabins which caused me a few problems on my mobility scooter. When the captain was making announcements you couldn’t understand what he was saying which wasn’t very helpful.  His messages were very garbled. The scenery was amazing from the ship thank goodness as unfortunately I couldn’t go on any excursions as they couldn’t accommodate mobility scooters.

We spoke to other people and they thought the same, and quite a lot of people including ourselves, went to the bistro instead after a couple of nights.The food in the bistro was good and plentiful, the only downside was trying to get a seat and table as the place was always packed.We were on an all inclusive package, which we would recommend as the price of drinks seemed high.The majority of the entertainment was very good and we could not fault the entertainment personnel , they were very good.All the excursions seemed to be well run, and speaking to other people, they seemed to enjoy them all. We thought some of them were expensive for what they were, but it was our choice whether we went or not.Now a couple of moans.Firstly there was only one power point in the cabin which as most people have multiple items that need charging made things difficult, especially as an adaptor could not be used as the point was too close to the dressing table for an adaptor to go in.Secondly, my wife recently had an operation which meant she could not  be too far from a toilet, and there was not enough in the public areas, she had to go wandering around the ship looking for one on numerous occasions .A few more would not come amiss Thirdly and our biggest moan was the lack of and the expense of getting Wi ,Fi.We have been on many a cruise ship and many a holiday, in which the majority we have received free Wi Fi, or if we have had to pay for it, the cost was relatively small.Not on the Columbus, the cost was very high and most of the time it was a bad service, surely with all the money we are paying for the cruise, the company should think of providing free Wi Fi as most other holiday resorts do. Even the staff moaned about the cost of Wi Fi.Overall, it was a very pleasant and enjoyable holiday, and apart from a couple of small moans would recommend the holiday to anybody.Just a small tip, if you can afford it, get a cabin with a balcony, as it got very warm in the cabin at night, and even with air conditioning, it would have been better with a window open",Sail Date: July 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Europe|,"London, United Kingdom"

I am reviewing the World Cruise 2019 so need more options - why not use 'World' as a destination?My initial impression was good.  Later, this changed.  The ship is old and 'tired' - needs complete refurbishment. The furniture is definitely showing its age.  Food was very good initially, but took a nose-dive about two thirds of the way through.  Mostly the vegetables were inedible - and almost all the desserts were 'cake-based' - little variety.  The meat was frequently tough.  I garve up eating in the Waterfront Restaurant in the evening because the service was unacceptably slow - half an hour between courses is ridiculous.The entertainment was not to my taste, but others enjoyed it.  I couldn't use the swimming pools because the water would have come over my head - as a non-swimmer this would not be a good idea.  Most of the activities were also not to my taste - not everyone wants bingo or karaoke - some more 'sophisticated' groups would have been good, such as reading group, classical music appreciation etc.  The Christian Fellowship was greatly appreciated - a big gold star for CMV for providing time and space for this.We were berthed in a lot of container ports where we couldn't walk.  As a single, independent traveller I did not want to do many of the shore excursions, but we were not supplied with decent information and a map of places we visited, so this was my main complaint about the trip.  CMV's administration was dreadful.  Most of the staff/crew were charming and helpful, but there were a few exceptions - sadly one of these was the Cruise Director.  My cabin was great, apart from the sound-proofing between me and next door - I could hear every word of their television programmes, although I couldn't hear anything else.  ?Television cable holes not sealed properly?  I was on Deck 10, near the front, in an outside cabin with a lovely large window - which was usually dirty.There was no outside 'quiet' space - there was background music everywhere.  The air conditioning needs a thorough overhaul - most passengers, including me, had some form of chest infection during the trip, with many people so ill they had to leave the ship to be hospitalised.  One passenger told me the air conditioning vents in his cabin had been opened by an engineer and a large quantity of dust, fluff and unknown 'stuff' had dropped out.  He was immediately moved to another cabin - but presumably this would have been repeated in every other cabin had the vents been opened.  The Medical Centre was overwhelmed, and the treatment for most people was IV antibiotics.  I had also suffered a similar infection on the same ship last September (which lasted until Christmas).  I did not use the Medical Centre on either occasion.  But saw some wonderful places, met some lovely people and generally got what I expected - apart from the three weeks or so when I was coughing!  I would have given a higher mark had CMV provided a simple map - showing roads, not just pretty pictures - and minimal information on the area immediately surrounding the ports.  As a single female, I do not get into a taxi alone - so I need to know walking routes and distances!

(Before you get het up - as there will be those who disagree entirely with this review - this is OUR opinion and we appreciate that many of the semi-professional moaners who were on board will even complain about the grammar or punctuation, let alone the content.)This ship is run by CMV and has been around the block a few times.Yes it is old, but we found it to be generally in good condition and everything worked.We had a cabin on the 10th floor and it was just as spacious as any we've had on P&O / RCI etc. In fact the shower was much bigger and we had a walk in wardrobe with yet more drawers.It did lack a balcony, mainly because they were not common when it was originally built, but if you have a suite on the 11th floor you can have one. Our journey was around the UK and lasted 10 days.We used the port parking, which went smoothly and boarded quicker than we have ever done with any other cruise line. Our fellow passengers were generally over 70 and seemed about  one in three were not that mobile, but the crew went out of their way to help.We ate breakfast in the Plantation Buffet ""free for all"" (but they always are), where there was not as much choice as some cruise lines, but plenty of options, even gluten free.  Admittedly, lunch in the buffet was a bit limited in variety, but the quality was fine.Our evening meals were in the Waterfront Restaurant on a table of 6 and not one of us could fault the food over the whole 10 days. Drink wise, there was wide selection of reasonably priced drinks in all bars (same drinks menu, but you could get certain other draught beers in one bar).The entertainment was on a smaller scale, but the in-house singers, dancers & band (though few in number) were as good as any of the big cruise lines. The guest acts varied. One managed to win over the usually comatose audience, but the lack of interaction unnerved the second guest act. Regarding the trips, I have never seen a cruise line so determined to help its older and less mobile guests (we are not included in either category) get on to and off of the tenders. Credit to all the crew. Now obviously this took more time than usual, so yet more fodder for the moaners, who funnily enough appreciated the help when it was their turn to board the tenders.We will certainly look at travelling on this ship and cruise line again.",Sail Date: May 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Europe|,"Eye, Peterborough"

Having experienced the RTW cruise I now know. Those who paid £7-10,000 may rate the cruise as adequate to great. Those who had paid for a suite would recommend it as very poor. Quality of food in main dinning room very poor. Always cheapest cuts of pork turkey/chicken and a pasta dish. Everything was frozen, dried or tinned. Dried eggs were revolutionary, tinned fruit was terrible when the fresh fruit in the ports we visited was so cheap. Fresh fruit when served was either unripe or past its ‘sell by date’.You could have frozen salmon steaks as an alternative but these were tasteless. We laughed every time we saw turkey and Brussel sprouts on the menu for formal nights. Yes after we complained for the twentyith time about the food the chefs went out of their way to find alternatives for a few of us. Food in the speciality restaurants (pay extra) was far superior and even hot. However the fusion restaurant is like sitting in a freezer when the outside temperature drops below 18 degrees. The cabin steward was excellent. But the suite is nothing like a suite it is a standard family room with a sofa bed.  The ship is 30 years old and the air conditioning broke 7 times. Meaning it was 16 degrees whilst in China and 28 degrees whilst in Asia. Staff admitted they couldn’t buy parts anymore for the air conditioning system. They held a suite cocktail party in the corridor in which the air conditioning had never worked. The noise from the deck above was constant during the day with staff and customers dragging beds/chairs along. At night the amplifiers for the parties meant the noise was louder in the suite than on deck. They constantly ran out of drinks. For example basics like diet tonic, beer and non branded spirits. They ran out of wine on the VIP package so they let us bring our own wine aboard and charged some people corkage (£7.50 a bottle). Personally CMV wine  was of very poor quality wines. Mainly 2018 vintage with screw tops. Lots of Greek products, wine, olive oil. Being Greek owned on reflection we should have realised this. Do not send anything of value to the laundry. They managed to shrink two dresses to T shirts. Then proceeded to stretch them from small to extra extra extra large. Another item they marked then removed the black marks with bleach resulting in a blue top becoming blue with white splodges  The best bits were the ports when we could get off and eat fresh food. However CMV use commercial ports in a lot of countries as opposed to the normal cruises berths. Meaning you had a delay in getting to the port gate shortening your time ashore as everyone was having to wait for busses as you were not allowed to walk in the commercial port Entertainment was poor if you are looking for value for money for a suite. The main show room is badly designed with few steps in the seating so you only get a good view if you sit in the front row. On the stalls level the glass screen large metal top is at sight level so you have to stand to get a good view. The first sitting guests took the seats at the designated show for the second sitting as they didn’t want to wait around for 1hr 45 minutes after their dinner. Result was no seats left 20 minutes prior to the show. People were in the show room one hour before the show playing cards etc just to get a seat! There were two excellent dancers. One male dancer didn’t dance for 3 months as he was so useless! One excellent female and one male singer. But these excellent singers were either ignored or drowned it by the others. The rest of the singers were of amateur dramatic level. The same shows were constantly repeated. Les miserable songs 9 plus times. Great if you were only on one sector but not if you went on a RTW cruise to be entertained. Lots of sunbeds were available but it was like being on a very bad Spanish beach in August with very high noise levels. Very few British crew members and the low level of spoken and written English meant it was like faulty towers at times. The staff however were in the main always smiling, trying their best and always apologising! Yes I can see how CMV Columbus could be rated as average to good by anyone who paid £7-10,000 for a RTW trip. But for the suite price it was very poor in comparison with paying exactly the same price each or even lower on say Cunard for a balciony room which what the suite really was.",Sail Date: January 2019|Cabin Type: Suite|Type of Trip: Friends|Destination: Australia|,"Hurghada, Egypt"

I contacted NCL to cancel the cruise and they have refused to issue a full refund.   In spite of my BIL's health issues and the international pandemic, NCL will issue only a 75% refund.  They feel justified to retain 25% ($2500!!) even though the cruise is 109 days away, they have provided no service to me or my companions and they have incurred no expense.   The $2500 fee would simply be profit to them.   I even spoke with a supervisor and they would not reconsider.   The supervisor explained that they even had a customer cry to them the night before requesting a refund because she had lost her job.   In this time of international health crisis and people losing jobs, NCL showed no compassion whatsoever.    Other companies are making concessions due to the pandemic but not NCL.

Many varieties of food, but lots of Asian/Indian style food here.The complementary restaurants are were to eat breakfast and dinner in my opinion. Tsar's, Azure and Chin Chin are the dinner spots you can choose.  Tsar and Azure are same menu I believe the only difference is Tsar a bit more Traditional and requires collared shirt (short or long)  and long pants (nothing fancy)   I ate 13/14 nights at Tsar's Palace and loved every meal.  Charles our server (we asked for him every night)  was the reason my cruise was special.. he made the dining experience a blast and I came home with a story from every meal.  Great job Charles!!!!!Entertainment: Things to do on this ship are a bit limited, there are activities to do, but are limited to large scale board games like chess, and shuffle board... there is a basketball court but was usually too windy or cold to use it.  The pool deck is open the whole time but the pool is empty due to rough seas (understandable) and limited to 4 small hot tubs... so many people took advantage of the indoor activities such as trivia, karaoke, and whatever other games they came up with.  I would not suggest this ship for people with children or teens.Staterooms: My room was quite nice, i was on the 8th deck in the middle close to O'Sheehans, this was an optimal place on the ship to be for navigating to anywhere on the ship.  The room was plenty large enough for all my things to hang up or put in drawers.

It took 3 days to sort out causing frustration to both my wife and I. Finally all done but not a good start. We noticed the staff were not as friendly as they should be nor attentive to our needs.

Staff were better in the specialty restaurants ""Le Bistro"" the pick of the lot and the Teppanyaki was entertaining.

Every stop had something unique and wonderful to offer. Excellent shore excursions available through the ship, but can select your own on shore if you prefer. (We mostly did ones from the ship and enjoyed them all.) Everyone on-board is so friendly and customer-oriented. While the food won't earn any Michelin stars, it is really quite good considering it's a cruise ship and not a 34-seat degustation venue. We especially enjoy the option of the specialty restaurants but also find the buffet and main dining options to be quite suitable. Believe me, no one goes hungry!! The evening entertainment, whether in the theater or the lounges, can't be beat. There is always a party of just quiet, enjoyable entertainment to be enjoyed and the caliber of the theater performers is top-notch, sometimes even Broadway worthy.

The Norwegian Jewel is a smaller ship than many of the others we experienced and older although it did get a refurbishment in 2018. We went for the state room with balcony on level nine which was adequate in size and very comfortable. The embarkation process in Sydney was the best I have experienced -speedy and welcoming. Customer service is clearly a priority for NCL. Our cruise started in Sydney and for the first 4 days we were at sea which is a long time especially as the Tasman Sea was choppy at times.As a result the swimming pool was also closed for 2/3 days. We felt our cruise really take off on day 4 when we experienced the very scenic Doubtful Sound,Dusky Sound and Milford Sound. The next day we arrived in Dunedin and went on our first shore tour namely Taieri Gorge Railway. A most interesting trip but grossly overpriced by NCL  at over USD 600 for the 2 of us. Other stops included Akaroa /Christchurch, Malborough Picton, Napier & Auckland which were all magnificent & enjoyable  to visit although it was disappointing that the Auckland shore time was abbreviated from the original schedule for whatever reason. It was also disappointing that the planned visit to stop at Tauranga did not take place due to a prolonged search for somebody who went overboard. The food throughout in common with other NCL ships is of high quality throughout. We tended to eat in the buffet restaurants for breakfast & lunch using the restaurants in the evening for dinner. We went to 3 speciality dining on 3 occasions: Cagneys , Tepanaki & Le Bistro all luxurious.We also went on 4 tour excursions : Dunedin Railway, Christchurch , Hawkes Bay Wine trail & Auckland City which were very enjoyable albeit very overpriced.During our cruise we visited a number of bars bur our favorite was Bliss Bar as we had the ultimate beverage package.Service throughout was friendly & tips gratefully received without pushing for them.

Embarkation was great, we arrived half an hour before the time we had to be on (not intentionally, we’d planned to be earlier) and ‘sailed’ through. When we got on we were told our cabin was ready if we wanted to go to it. Our luggage was delivered to the cabin really quickly too.We had two cabins, 5071 and 5065 so not too far apart. Cabins were great, although I smelt smoke (5071) on a few occasions. The steward for my cabin (Ding) was great, he’d always say hello even if he was up the corridor, and my room was always made up/ down quickly. The steward for the other cabin was a bit slower but friendly. Didn’t hear any noise from above, but as my room was next to a store for the equipment for getting off in port, I did hear that (no big deal and it was during waking hours anyway). Another benefit of being on deck 5 is that you don’t have far to go on port days to get off! We ate all the time in the garden cafe as we liked the choice/ quality of the buffet food and the self service suited us well. The only downside was other passengers who took up a table of 4 with one or two people meaning we struggled to get seats for our party of 3. Staff were all really friendly and helpful - although I did have to go to guest services on the first day as the mini bar in my room was empty apart from an open bottle of water and I wanted to make sure I wasn’t charged for drinking it all! The lady on the desk didn’t say much and I left without knowing what was happening (she phoned her supervisor about it but didn’t tell me what was happening)- however it was sorted later on that day. Communication there could have been better. Wasn’t overly excited with the entertainment but I guess you can’t please everyone! Loved Candice Glover, she has an amazing voice. Love brothers and Lira were good too. The bliss lounge was my favourite bar, but the music could have been quieter and still been as good. The only real downside of the cruise was some of the other passengers- as above the issue with the tables, people walking two abreast in corridors and getting annoyed when they have to move to let you past, people getting in lifts before people get out, people calling over waiters in the bars and then taking ages to decide what they want to drink etc. Loved the freestyle aspect of the cruise, liked not having to get dressed up for dinner,  or having to book anything - it felt like a real holiday!",Sail Date: December 2019|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: Family (multi-generational)|Destination: Australia|,"Dundee, United Kingdom"

Familiarity with the ship made finding our way around easy but some things changed for the worse for our return visit. Restaurants still provide great food with flexible timelines but O'Sheehans menu offered less variety and was no longer our favourite haunt. Specialty dining restaurants for which you pay a surcharge were a mixed bag (Cagney's was rushed, the Brazilian restaurant hade great ambience and plentiful food which was very salty, Le Bistro fantastic and Teppanyaki very entertaining). Fantastic entertainment but not a lot of options for numerous sea days. Our first cruise with Norwegian around NZ featured nightly towel animals in our cabin which was fun and even offered towel folding courses but these no longer exist and numerous passengers complained about this. Overall fantastic staff and service but exorbitantly priced shore excursions were neither appreciated or utilised by us.

Norwegian has a different philosophy, one they call ""Freestyle.""  Rather than being controlling about where you have dinner, who you sit with, what you do during the day, they provide multiple options of different restaurant-style ethnic options, different sorts of music, etc.  You get a ""newspaper"" each day telling what's happening when and where, and you do what you want.  Don't do what you don't want.  That is, they treat you like an adult.  That made the cruise, delightful, fun, easy, filled with choices, and the staff was available and always helpful.  The Alaska cruise we were on was delightful and interesting. The shore excursion options were multiple and varied.  The pilot always turned the ship so everyone got to look at the glaciers.  Wildlife and whales of many kinds were there for viewing, in abundance.  The cabin we had on the outside was wonderful, and we often had the door ajar (weather permitting) to listen to the sound of the ship on the water.

While onboard the Norwegian Jewel Cruise Ship, we enquired about splurging on the BEAR tour ($220 USD each). We live in Canada so were ONLY were interested in seeing Grizzly Bears (as we can see brown and black bears daily in our backyard). The Norwegian Jewel Sales Shore Team specifically said “yes you will see GRIZZLY Bears eating salmon, if you don’t you will get $100 refund each” before booking this tour. We since learnt that there are NO Grizzlies on the island, so the South American sales lady lied to our faces to make a $660 USD sale. Our tour was only 2 hours long (should have been 3.5 hours) because there was literally absolutely nothing to see except an injured eagle in a cage called Lucy and a banana slug. When we returned to get our promised refund, the Norwegian Jewel Shore Excursion Team were all EXTREMELY rude, defensive, deflective and unprofessional. We ended up getting a very small refund (after 2 days of discussions) due to the trip being shorter than usual, but nothing satisfactory. The Shore Excursion Team tried to ignore us saying ""we will get back to you"" but never did. The Mexican manager and the Indian Salesman were the worst - very rude and not interested in us whatsoever. Because my parents are seniors they ""hoped they would go away"" and said 'no one else has complained'. Well, after reading many other reviews on this site, we are DEFINITELY not the only family treated this way. We then contacted SUSAN WORTHY in Australia, who deals with written complaints. She too is another NCL agent who also does not provide professional customer service. It is obvious once the sale is made - they just do not care.This operation should be illegal as the sales team over promised everything and failed to give the promised refund. (Note- Some people in my group saw one brown bear but they needed binoculars to see it properly..) It was also not a GRIZZLY bear as promised. An absolute rip-off and disgrace of an operation. We NEVER want to go on a Norwegian cruise line again because of this awful experience. Norwegian Cruise Ship senior management .. please contact me with an appropriate response.

First stop was Hubbard Glacier, it was breathtaking. We got to see and hear ice calving. It was truly hard to take in everything we saw at this glacier. Second stop was Hoonah, and we did a whale watching tour IS WAS AWESOME. We booked the excursion with Hoonah Tours. Hoonah is a very small town to walk around but the favor of the town is very unique. Next port was Juneau, we took a cab  ($35) to the Mendenhall glacier and hiked to Nugget Falls. Just beautiful. We had plenty of time to walk around Juneau. Very cute town. We were supposed to leave Juneau at 1pm but we were not able to visit the Sawyer Glacier due to too much ice in the water. We had heard their was an earthquake at the Glacier the Friday before we got there, so we stayed in Juneau till 9pm. Next port was Skagway, we rented a Jeep and drove to Emerald Lake, Carcross, a suspension bridge and stopped to see a desert, yes a desert! Next port was Ketchikan, we rented a Zodiac boat and were lucky enough to find a whale bubble feeding and it breached the water. We had great weather during our cruise. We spent time in the hot tubes and even went in the pool, which was heated. The staff was awesome on the Jewel. We meet so many nice people on the ship.

That took a bit of sorting out. We spent the majority of the cruise at sea which was fine and the time spent around the Dawes Glacier was good as the ship slowly turned to give everyone a view.

While the NCL Jewel is a very nice ship and was just refurbished in 2018, I found the food and staff to be mediocre.  You hear so much about delicious food on cruises and we were sorely disappointed.  Out of a seven day cruise, I would say we have three really good, high quality meals and those were restaurants we paid extra for in our cruise package.  Forgo Chin Chin -- was the worst meal we've had anywhere -- either on a ship or on land.  The best restaurant was Cagney's -- that was a true fine dining experience and the steaks were delicious.  In terms of staff -- mediocre at best.  Some truly friendly and accommodating members, many aloof and non-caring.  Many staff seemed to be just tired.  Could it be that we took the last cruise of the season?  At any rate, be it the first cruise or the last cruise, I believe staff should be consistent across the board.  At the guest services counter, Monica, a customer service rep actually argued with us that we didn't book an anniversary package on the right date even though we had paperwork to prove it.  Why not just apologize and accommodate our request of a credit without arguing?  It's that type of lack of service that goes a long way -- in the wrong direction.

A highly motivated and professional staff wowed the passengers with their commitment to service, though English as a second language issues with the staff did arise every now and then.Overall, given the modest price tag, this is a very good value as Alaska cruises go, and the ""bang for the buck"" was impressive.The entertainment was outstanding.  There was a nice variety of performance types, and the timing and scheduling were well-conceived.  Multiple venues that ranged from the grand hall to smaller stages spread around the ship helped to balance traffic and provide for meeting the different entertainment interests of the guests.  From a very polished Ukranian jazz band, to a classically trained and drop-dead gorgeous Australian stage dancer, to a profoundly talented South American acoustic guitarist, all the way to American rock singers who hit every note, the entertainment was flawless.  Cruise Director ""Dan the Man"" certainly deserves an enormous amount of credit for managing his entertainment budget with incredible skill and foresight.Food was OK, but the menus were repetitive, and on a seven-day cruise, that's an issue.  None of the food was exceptional.  Despite being in Alaska, there was virtually no seafood.  The portions in the Chinese food restaurant were small, and we ate again at another place on the ship less than an hour after finishing dinner there.  All of the restaurants were very clean and well-staffed.  Avoid what they call biscuits in the buffet.  They were hard as a rock, dry, and lacking in taste.  Clearly, the procurement managers for Norwegian Cruise Lines have not had biscuits made in the South.  The eggs, though, were real and not powdered.  The bacon was mostly fat.  Salads were very fresh, somehow, throughout the duration of the cruise.  Burgers were lean yet moist and well prepared.  Hot dogs were flavorful and as high of quality as a hot dog can be, likewise well prepared.          We had an interior cabin, which was fine except for the fact that the toilet in the bathroom was so close to the facing wall of the bathroom that a person could not sit on the toilet facing forward.  Steward staff members for room attention were excellent.Getting on and off the ship for port stops was well managed.  There was a feeling of reassuring safety without it being heavy-handed.All in all, on a scale of 1-10, the entertainment was a 10, the general presentation, cleanliness, and organization of the ship was a 10, the itinerary was a 10, and the food was a 6.  This is an exceedingly good value for under $450 per person for a seven-day cruise.

I recently got back from a 7 day inside passage cruise that left out of Seward, Alaska and ended in Vancouver, Canada.  Loved every minute of my epic adventure.  The ship is beautiful, clean, well-staffed with the nicest people, and so in tune with making their passengers have an incredible experience.  The excursions offered, the dining rooms and food, the service was unbeatable.  The captain took us as close as he could to the Hubbard Glacier which is a sight to behold for sure.  He took his time so that we would all get the most out of its endless beauty.  I took a helicopter ride onto the Mendenhall Glacier which is a must and so worth the price. The bartender, Ali, at the Mojito Bar was so fun.  Several people from my singles group as well as from another group met up every night there at 5:30 for the best mojitos, and conversation. Several specialty restaurants are onboard but I would have been fine eating in the general dining rooms for every meal as the food and service and presentation and beautiful surroundings made dining an extremely pleasant experience every time.  My favorite specialty restaurant however was Le Bistro, with it's fine French food.  I had acupuncture done onboard at the Spa which gave new meaning to my knee which had hurt so badly, I had to think about how to put one foot in front of the other.  Immediate relief after just one treatment and after three treatments, pain totally gone till this day.  People are so happy on a cruise which is so invigorating.  NCL is the best and I have already booked two more cruises, one to NZ out of Sydney, Australia and another that leaves from Quebec City down to Boston.  Two years ago, I did the Hawaiian cruise out of Honolulu with NCL.  That too was beyond words.  Would love to go again.  I totally recommend this cruise line.

When we hit a port we charge off and we come back aboard as the gang plank makes a gap.  That said, I have little to say about on board activities.  But otherwise..... Our cabin was immaculate, very comfortable (if small- we went least expensive) and our steward took excellent care of us doing everything in his power to make us happy and comfortable- even if we frightened him once when he came in and saw my legs protruding from under our bed (an excellent place to store suitcases and I was in the process of retrieving them) and he was firmly convinced that I was my wife's lover in the process of hiding from her husband entering the cabin.  Be that as it may, he did an excellent job.  The food was superb- NCL feeds you well and <burp> super abundantly. We had two meals in the non-prepaid restaurants- both quite good- but the Czar's place was the equal of either and the buffet was of good quality and was super fast and convenient.     The ports (Ketchikan, Juneau, Skagway) were quite fun and Glacier Bay National Park was.... monumental/beautiful/majestic/imposing.   We even got to see the Northern Lights, which was an added bonus.  I have no complaints on NCL and we will likely use them again.  Was it a 5 star cruise? No.   Did we PAY for a 5 star cruise?

I traveled with the transportation service provided by the cruise line to better relieve stress to plan transportation; in addition I also opt'd into the travel protection so if there were any conflicts of arrival times or airline arrangements, the cruise line made sure to take care of myself and my son. It's just that type of extra attention to details that I appreciate on vacations. The Norwegian website is extremely easy to use and everything you need in available.

This worked to our advantage because when we arrived, wildfires prevented travel to Denali anyway. There were so many food options that were part of our package. We usually ate in the Garden Cafe. Huge selection, fresh and tasty. There is hot sauce scattered about if you like to add :) We did not do any separate drinks or internet packages, and did not miss them. A beer was $8. We were given a complimentary bottle of champagne for being return customers. Entertainment was varied. We liked trivia, karaoke, sing-a-longs with Andy in the Magnum bar, Carl the Comedian, and the Cirque Bijou! We spent plenty of time in the pools and jacuzzis, though they did get crowded at times.

From the first day, we were treated courteously and professionally, the staff working hard to make sure everything was to our liking, from the cabin attendant to the cruise director. The food on the free-style cruising was great; the specialty restaurants had a limited selection of entrees, but all were prepared very well, presented very well, and tasted great. The bars were also great - get the drink package so you never have to pay for a beverage, unless the menu price if over $15 (most were not). The bar staff were attentive and polite. Don't bother with the internet package - you can connect to your service when in port. There is something strange with the ship's system; we had friends that ran through their 150 minutes in a day, probably due to improper logout. I and my wife paid the $9.95 to use the ship's texting service - without it and without the internet package your phone is just a camera. Only minor problems with this system - I kept getting requests to connect to wi-fi (I was in airplane mode). This was never a problem, just a nuisance.The entertainment was also excellent. We rated the comedian a 3 on a scale of 1 to 5; he was funny, but not roaring laughter funny. The other acts we rated 5. Excellent singing, dancing, and acrobatics.We did three excursions, and all were great. I have rated these separate from this review, as they were all run by private vendors.We did continue after the cruise on the 5 day land excursion to Denali and Anchorage. I will write a separate review on this as it was also run by a private vendor.The only disappointment was on the day of departure. We were traveling with my sister and her husband. She has a prosthetic leg and used a scooter most of the trip to get around. It was leased through Norwegian, was in her room when she boarded, and was to be left at the hotel in Anchorage upon ending the land tour. This was clearly stated in the documentation she had been provided. However, upon leaving, the staff would not allow her to leave with the scooter, and refused to read the papers she had. They called their supervisor, who called someone else. Eventually someone came down, looked at the paper and asked the staff ""What's the problem? She can take this. It says so right here."" Then it was OK. Of course this took over 40 minutes to sort out, while everyone else on the land tour sat in the bus wondering what was going on. I can only say this one staff member had one job, and that was to account for all scooters. Reading the orders was not part of his duties. But that was a slight ruffle in an otherwise spotless and fantastic cruise. I would certainly recommend this cruise line to anyone, and will be booking another with them (Europe, maybe) within the next three years.",Sail Date: July 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Alaska|,

People always talk about all the food available on cruises, but for some of us you hardly eat anything. As a vegan the crew does have a couple of people available to help plan your specialty diet meals.  But for every meal this requires a major effort and the available foods aren't always appealing. At the buffet, which is the most convenient way to eat on a cruise, you have to ask a chef what foods are vegan, this is also a major effort for both parties. It would be more convenient to include some vegan meals in the overall menus at all restaurants and make sure vegan foods are labeled at the buffet.

The buffet restaurant was busy and loud at each meal service, but the waiter service restaurant was much calmer and the service was very attentive.  The 'freestyle' dining suited us, we could eat any time we liked during opening hours and never had to wait for a table on our own.  We didn't eat in any of the non inclusive restaurants as we didn't feel the need.  We went to the evening entertainment every night - some were OK-ish, others were astounding.  All  staff are professional, courteous and friendly.The cruise itself was everything we hoped for.  The weather certainly helped with very calm seas.  We saw humpback whales every day, as well as dolphins, sea otters, seals ...... fantastic wildlife.  We were up at 4.30am each morning on the top deck to watch the sunrise and make sure we didn't miss anything.  The visits to Glacier Bay and the Hubbard Glacier will stay with us forever.  There is nothing to beat sailing serenely along, watching the beautiful scenery coming closer and closer, as the excellent captain and crew navigate towards the glaciers.  Don't forget your binoculars.The port visits are Ketchikan, Juneau (we were there on Independence Day) and Skagway which, together with the two days of glacier cruising, meant that we only had one sea day to get 'bored' - as that day was the first full day on the ship, we had plenty of time to wander around and find out where everything was, as well as more wildlife watching.

We could not have asked for a better week.  The weather was perfect - broke all the heat records - and clear for glacier and landscape viewing.  The ship was clean and well laid out.  We had a small room on the 4th deck.  It was a little cramped, but we did not spend much time in the cabin. Too much to do!  It was so nice to walk on the promenade deck or the upper sun deck.  The crew were amazingly friendly.  We got to meet people from all over the world.  The best thing about cruising with Norwegian is the freedom.  No set dining schedule and no feeling that you have to dress up.  It was truly relaxing.  We enjoyed going to the art lectures and other demonstrations that were offered.  The two days at sea where we toured the glaciers was amazing.  They had park rangers come aboard and explain what we were seeing and help us to spot wildlife.  The embarkation and disembarkation process was well organized and went smoothly.  Getting on off and on the ship at ports for shore excursion was also very well set up.  The food was good and there was plenty of it.  I recommend O'Sheehan's for breakfast.  It was a nice way to get away from the crowds and enjoy a quiet, relaxed meal.

One day a ranger came on the boat and narrated the tour of the national park whilst we stood on decks and took photos.  Majestic and wonderful experience.The entertainment staff and the wait staff also work extremely hard to make the cruise enjoyable.  Indeed, we quite enjoyed the band in the bar at the front of the boat on the 12th floor.  There also seemed to be lots of activities for every type person from painting to singing to gambling.However, there were some negatives.  The food in most venues, including the specialty restaurants, was at best mediocre.  The balcony suites were tiny and unfortunately for us we were on the 11th floor under the kitchen where they work and move objects from midnight to 2 a.m. and begin again at 4 a.m.  We complained and NCL apologized and gave us a bottle of wine and $150 credit, BUT before you book a room, I recommend that you check the deck plan to see what is immediately above you.  Also, there are not enough electrical outlets in the rooms and the only one is far away from the bed.Also, the people in ""Guest Services"" never know the answers to any questions and are rarely helpful.  We were anxious to find out details about the 4-day extension we had booked through NCL and the guest service people basically took the position that it was not within their job description to know that information.",Sail Date: June 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Friends|Destination: Alaska|,Texas

The food was horrible. The good: the staff were friendly, the shows were fun, the ship was on time, the rooms were clean, and more. BUT part of what is supposed to be great about cruises is the dining. It was beyond horrible on this ship. So many things were not fresh or even near fresh. For example: A waffle is a pretty easy thing to cook - mix some batter and throw it in a waffle iron. Mix up 800 gallons of batter if you need to and put it in a waffle iron as they are ordered. Nope - they serve a microwaved waffle that is rubbery and inedible. I had multiple meals that were completely inedible. The only saving grace was Le Bistrot which somehow seemed to have it together.

When a customer tells you they have a drink package— try to trust them and give them the pepsi which costs you 10 cents rather than hassle them with getting their cruise charge card out everytime to prove it.

It's a lovely ship too and as we've come to expect on a cruise, with excellent service as standard. Entertainment was very good and varied and we particularly enjoyed evenings spent in Magnum's listening to Ariel and Bernie. Although it's a big ship, we made friends with fellow guests with whom we still keep in touch. The itinery was just wonderful. The trip included 2 nights pre cruise in Singapore and 2 post cruise in Hong Kong and during the cruise we visited Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia. We only did one ship excursion. The rest of the time we took our chances at the ports,joined up with other guests and got local taxi drivers to show us round. Not only did they drive us around, they acted like tour guides for the day and much cheaper than ship excursions. If you do this trip, look out for Feisal at the port for Bangkok. He is amazing! I'm giving this 4 instead of 5 stars because of inconsistency with the food, varying from very good to disappointing, especially with the steak which you'd think an American ship would get spot on! The buffet at lunchtime and breakfast can be stressful too and the 'complimentary' breakfast in the room comes with a charge!

Here are some thoughts (we had a balcony room):Staff: With only a few exceptions, the staff was pleasant and accommodating.  Our room steward, Le, was exceptionally good (and this is probably the most important person on your cruise).  Entertainment: Well executed and diverting, the evening shows were enjoyable if mostly forgettable.  There was a comic aboard as well, he was talented and amusing.  There were numerous trivia, game show, and bingo events.  The best events were informational sessions about the glaciers, and Q&As with the ship leadership team and entertainment staff. Casino:  Like a little corner of Vegas, actually. I actually won a few bucks on slots(!), I was shocked given the reputation of the cruise ship casinos. The casino is closed while in ports.Port Calls: These were on time arrivals and departures, but seemed to enjoy the furthest berths in Juneau and Ketchikan.  If you are getting on a vehicle and going somewhere, I recommend booking with the cruise-line. If you are staying close to town, I'd say its pretty safe to book your attractions directly and save a few dollars.  We did so and had no reason to worry.Spa: I highly recommend the ""Thermal Suite"" if you love jacuzzis, steam rooms and peace and quiet.  I delighted in going here everyday following my workout in the gym.  The locker room also has a full-size shower that made me the envy of my family.  Regrettably, I have to say that the front-desk spa staff was pleasant, but wholly preoccupied with sales rather than service.Gym: Well equipped and pretty quiet as long as you don't work out between 6am and  9am.  Expect a wait for equipment (treadmills, bikes, etc.) if you do.Stateroom: As noted, a balcony.  I highly recommend a balcony for the Alaska cruises since you will be doing some epic sightseeing around the glaciers.  This beats fighting for space on the decks.  Don't worry about your view, the ship is maneuvered in these locations to provide every stateroom a view.  The stateroom has plenty of space to store things, but not a lot of space to move around in for three people.  Library and Card Room:  Although we didn't use these, we did notice that they were almost always packed.Dining:  We ate at three specialty restaurants, the pub (O'Sheehans) and  the buffet.  Overall all, the food aboard gets a 3 out of 5 stars from me. Edible and tasty, but not measuring up to the better restaurants on land I've been too.  Moderno stood out.  I wish I had tried Cagney's and the Sushi bar.     Garden Cafe Buffet:  Largely met our dining needs, especially breakfast.  Lots of choices, including vegetarian options.  Sometimes some of the entrees were a bit too salty for my tastes.  Many vegetable/fruit choices abound.  Grilled vegetables were a welcome fixture.     O'sheehans: Nice change of pace atmosphere-wise but the food did not significantly differ from the Buffet in quality.  The one exception seemed to be the wings, which were very tasty!     La Cucina: Italian.  I felt the service was perfunctory and the food quality institutional.  I had the Shrimp Fra Diavalo.  Hailing originally from the NYC area, I have pretty high standards for Italian, this didn't meet them.  A largely forgettable meal.     Le Bistro: French. Better.  Solid service, good food.  I had seared scallops (which tasted a bit too much of the searing for my liking) and my family members both had Coq au Vin (which I tried and was excellent).       Moderno: Brazilian Steakhouse.  Best.  Excellent service, excellent meat.  Only one of the meat offerings seemed a bit dry (so that's about 1 out of 8).  The sides bar included some sushi as well.     Operations:   We had a number of add-ons that needed to be delivered to our stateroom and that went down flawlessly.  I was impressed!  We had good weather for the entire cruise, the only times I sensed that we were on a ship were in open water of Queen Charlotte Sound and The Gulf of Alaska.  The ship could use far more informational signage throughout, especially in the cruise terminal Vancouver.  Debarkation was a breeze and we didn't need to be off the ship until 9:45am in Seaward.",Sail Date: June 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Family (older kids)|Destination: Alaska|,Honolulu

Our picture window cabin was fine, plenty of storage and an adequate, but small, bathroom.  It was clean, with comfortable beds and we had very good service from the housekeeping staff.  All the staff are friendly and helpful.  We paid for the drinks and dining extra which was well worth while as compared with the bar prices (+ 20% service charge) and the extra dining charges although of course you do not have to pay extra to eat,it is nice to do so but there are plenty of included dining rooms and of course the buffet where the dress is very casual if you have had a long day sunbathing!!The pool are was good, shops limited and expensive but worth a look.  Reception was helpful.  The bad points.  Checking in at Singapore.  We had read all the ship information where it stated that a visa was required for Cambodia just to GO ASHORE there.  Having read bad reviews of the local area and not wanting to go on a ship tour we said no thank you when asked to sign for a 75 US dollar visa (in UK it would have cost £25) We were told we could not board the ship without a visa as it was mandatory to have a visa to even dock in their waters.  When we showed the officer the NCL information he said, yes, they knew about it and were working on it!!  To continue we had to pay for the visa.  That evening there were long queues complaining of the same thing. NCL should have made their passengers know in advance of the WRONG INFORMATION on their website. The local town was not safe, with lots of passengers complaining of menacing begging when in the town, which confirmed our wish not to  disembark.  It would have cost two of us US dollars 150 plus maybe another US 250 for an over-priced tour we did not want. When we got the ship's final account on the last morning of the cruise we found that we had been refunded the visa cost, but do not know if everyone did or just us as we complained, and asked for proof that we had not disembarked - they gave us a print out from the ship's disembarkment log for the day. It ended up well for us but caused a lot of problems right at the beginning of the cruise when we nearly were not allowed to board!Ko Samui is a tender port, reached by the ship's lifeboats.  Just around the 3/4 of an hour before the last boarding time, with long, long queues for the tenders, the boat before the one we would have been on was bottoming due to a low tide and could not sail.  After quite a long wait we were told we would have to go to another pier where the water was deeper.  Considering the long queues and narrow pier, we were of course at the back when we reached this pier so after an hour queuing we had another 3/4 hour waiting at a dock where the steps down did not have a safety fence or hand rail, quite unsafe for the less mobile passengers.  It was very hot and many passengers were feeling the strain of waiting in the sun for so long. We eventually got back to the ship and were quite late leaving.  This should have been avoidable - surely the ship and harbour master communicate?  They should have announced before the queues formed that another dock would be used.  It caused quite a lot of confusion, pushing and shoving etc. and there did not appear to be any one of authority taking charge and bringing order to the situation.Sorry, NCL, hopefully you will not let your standards drop as we have usually enjoyed our cruises with you and have reached Platinum X standard.The rest of the cruise was good but it is a shame when avoidable things such as above are allowed to happen.",Sail Date: March 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Asia|,"Leeds, United Kingdom"

Norwegian scans your luggage and if they find wine they make you pick up your luggage and pay service charge of $15 a bottle. EVERYTHING on the ship is expensive and the the excursions are outrageous. They price gouge their customers at every single opportunity!!!! There supplemental restaurants are substandard and there chefs are cooks NOT chefs!! Cagneys was steak was a HUGE grilled piece of fat with perhaps 35% meat on it!!!

For example, the pastry on the Jewel was mass produced like on other cruise lines but the pastry other cruise lines tastes like it was mass produced but not so on the Jewel.  The steaks on the Jewel were very tasty and ""fork tender"".  There were some food items that I was not especially fond of but the variety of other good food was amazing. The Jewel is not a ""super-sized"" cruise ship (less that 2,500 passengers) so it was generally less crowded that the larger ships.  Things I did not like about the Jewel was the fitness center did not open until 6 AM and sometimes the hours were inconsistent.  In addition, light snacks and coffee were not available until after 7 AM.  I like coffee very early and found the secret after a few days on-board. The more generous area allocated to tobaco users was also better and it didn't seem to offend non-smokers.  I feel like other cruise lines are being too politically correct in the severe limitations on smokers.We flew to Singapore for our cruise but our flight stopped in Hong Kong (from Dallas) first so we elected to stay for two days and then fly onward to Singapre and arrived two days before the cruise so we could see this city as well. After a day at sea we aririved at Ko Samui, Thailand, a resort island.  The second stop on our cruise was Thailand where we stayed two days near Bancock after a day at sea.  Our next stop was Cambodia and finaly to Vietnam.  Our first stop was near Saigon (Ho Chi Min City), then Da Nang and last stop was Ha Long Bay near Hanoi.  A day at sea and we were back in Hong Kong.The 16 hour flight to Hong Kong on American Airlines (from Dallas) was very tiring and the food was underwhelming.  The flight home was 14 hours and the food was equally bad.

We chose an outside cabin (porthole only) on Deck 4 of the ship. The cabin was a great size & had everything that we needed so we were happy cruisersWe were pleasantly surprised & this was perfect for us. The porthole was much larger than we anticipated & we didn't have a problem with Deck 4. If the stairs got too much we just jumped in the lift.The service on board was great & our cabin steward Carroll was just lovely. He took such great care of us & always had our cabin looking great (clean & tidy). Carroll  ALWAYS had a smile on his face & nothing was a problem. He really gave us 100%He is a credit to the cruise line & helped make our holiday so memorable.The only restaurants we ate in were the complimentary dining rooms & always enjoyed our mealsWe also had several meals in the 'buffet' & I have to say it's the BEST buffet we have ever had on a cruise line. My husband generally isn't impressed with buffet style dining but even this one won him over... really nice food!Entertainment... where do I start. The evening shows were just fabulous. Such a great mix of entertainment & so professional with some amazing special guests. We were so impressed we truly enjoyed the performances.The main criticism was the changes at ports due to problems with the ship. Times were changed & lengths of stay were altered & when you have Independent Tours booked it really becomes a nightmare. Obviously they cater to guests who book tours through the cruise line which I understand but the charges for these tours are exorbitant. This was a real inconvenience as we were busy chasing up tour companies etc & trying to reschedule or sadly we just missed out completely when we should be enjoying ourselves.On the whole we had a wonderful time & would definitely recommend this ship,Sail Date: November 2018|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Australia|,Mangerton

The cruise program truly provided a valuable educational experience in addition to the typical entertainment.  There were daily lectures regarding not only the destinations we would be visiting but also about the biology, wildlife, and geology we would be experiencing.  The lectures were held in the main theatre and were packed to the gills with an interested audience.  I spent a lot of time on deck watching for countless birds along with several other bird watchers from all over the world.  The excitement each day of getting closer and closer to Antarctica was palpable.  When we entered Schollart Channel and Paradise Bay, you could hear a pin drop on deck.

It has always been a dream of ours to see the Antarctic and although we may have preferred to get off on the continent, this cruise offered us an opportunity to see this part of the world without breaking the bank. We had done three cruises before with other lines and really didn’t know what to expect of Celebrity. When we looked at reviews, some were good and others well…In any event here is what we think of it. Although there were a lot of negative comment about the Buenos Aires port and especially the boarding process, we found it well organized and efficient. From the time we were dropped off by our transfer to the time we boarded the ship was maybe 45 minutes. We had concierge service and once on board we were greeted and shown to our cabin. The only glitch for the process was the fact that my suitcase ended up in someone else’s cabin and I didn’t get it till around 2100hrs. We had a cabin on the 9th floor at the back of the ship; it was comfortable with a good size balcony. The ship is not new but appears well maintained and clean. Here is our list of pros and cons:Pros: •	Easy boarding process in a busy operational port•	Great itinerary and ports of call (Ushuaia, Stanley, Puerto Madryn and Montevideo) if Antarctica is what you are aiming to see.•	Great guest speakers and entertainment for the many sea days. (scientists and subject matter experts on wildlife in the area)•	Meals were excellent; my wife has sensitivity to gluten, soy and dairy. The kitchen bent over backwards to accommodate her needs. She picked her meals the day before and everything was always prepared when we went to the dining room. Guest’s services followed up with us to ensure we were satisfied with the meals.•	We took the basic unlimited 1 device internet package. I have to say that I was impressed with it. Although slow to send pictures to our children while in Antarctica, the email and messages were downloading quickly and the system never failed to download documents for us.•	Great service by the staff on the boat (dining room, room attendants)•	Easy and well planned process for getting off and on the ship at the various ports of calls.•	We took an excursion with Celebrity on Falkland Islands (Bertha’s beach) and were pleased with it and felt that it was good value for the price.•	Didn’t feel pressure from the staff to buy packages although there were certainly advertising no one bothered us once we politely declined.•	Although Celebrity can’t be blamed or take credit for the weather, we had excellent weather and that made our experience even more enjoyable. The Captain was able to do a 360 at Cape Horn and at several locations in Antarctica. The seas were calm throughout our voyage and this added to the overall experience. We saw penguins, seals and whales and countless birds which were spectacular.•	The process of getting off the ship was smooth; it took 36 minutes from the time we got off the ship to the time we left the terminal parking lot. This includes a 15 minutes bus ride.Cons:•	Really not much negative to say.. the ship is going for refurbishment sometime this year, which should address some minor issues with dining room chair comfort.",Sail Date: February 2020|Cabin Type: Suite|Type of Trip: |Destination: Antarctica|,

Our cabin was large and comfortable with a balcony. As with any cruise ship we’ve traveled on, the food was good but not A plus, but I loved the cafeteria with lots of stations where you could enjoy a wide selection at any meal. And there’s always ice cream available. For dinner we always ate in the main dining room, where our waiter and his assistant were very hard working and helpful. The entertainment was really good, and we went to interesting shows almost every night and sometimes in the afternoon, a plus because there were many at sea days. The cruise director, Alesandro, was fabulous as was our naturalist.  It’s a once in a lifetime experience to sail through the arctic scenery. I wish we’d seen more wild life–whales, seals and penguins. The weather was mostly great, with smooth sailing even in the Drake Passage. The captain got our large ship into Paradice Bay with it’s spectacular peaks and glaciers.  My main disappoint was that high winds kept us from docking in the Falklands, so we missed a great penguin experience. I loved the pastry shop, I think on deck 5. The pastries are free, but you must pay for drinks unless you have a drink package, which I highly recommend. It includes not only alcoholic drinks but coffee drinks and soft drinks. There’s also a casino on board which one of our dinner tablemates enjoyed a lot. We didn’t even use the free chips they gave up. Just not our thing. The spa is very good but expensive. My main complaint is that you have to leave the ship early in the morning and flights back to the U.S. don’t leave until late afternoon or evening. Even taking an excursion we had to wait around the airport for eleven hours! With few places to sit because you can’t check in until three hours before you flight. The ship needs to think about other tours that would take up more of the day before you can get on your flight. I would have, for example, enjoyed a trip to a ranchero.

This overall experience was the worst yet.  Celebrity operates out of a tent rather than a cruise ship terminal in San Antonio, Chile where I boarded the Eclipse.  I was shocked to be demanded by the check-in person to surrender my passport to her prior to stepping onto the ship which I was told at the time had no established line of communication between her and the ship I was boarding.  The Eclipse is very familiar to me.  I was last aboard just five months prior to this sailing from Vancouver BC round trip heading to Alaska.  The ship is in need of an update.  The carpets were dirty.  Our stateroom was worn and uninteresting.  The room service experience was awful.  After begging for a fresh fruit drink without alcohol which was good they outright refused to make me another.  i ordered a bowl of chicken soup and asked for crackers two times and no crackers were delivered with the soup.  Our second and fourth port of call was cancelled due to bad weather so we had too many ""at sea"" days with absolutely nothing to do.  The only available entertainment was the Casino which I personally enjoy.  The staff in the Casino were extremely accommodating and friendly.  It was the only time during the cruise I wasn't nickel and dime'd to death if I ordered a drink.  On Celebrity, if you don't buy a drink package you save more money. I was never charged for drinks in the Casino.  My husband couldn't purchase aspirin on the ship because nothing is open on the ship's retail shops when the ship is in port.  He went to the Medical suite to try and get an aspirin and was told he could not get one unless he agreed to be medically evaluated by medical staff who would charge him $140 USD for the appointment.  Paying $140 for an aspirin is perverted and proves that piracy at sea exists and is alive and well on Celebrity.  Not all of the staff is friendly or trained well with respect to how to handle the carriage trade.  As far as dining room service goes, don't expect the usual.  Americans for the most part drink coffee black, some drink it with creme.  The container sitting on your breakfast table is milk.  On several occasions when I asked for creme the attendant was annoyed.  On two occasions I was told ""there is no creme on board"".  The dining room menu one day offered arugula salad.  I ordered it and was brought an iceburg lettuce salad which I refused, pointing out what the menu offered.  And the very worst part of all of this, be prepared to pay service tips on top of service tips.  I was charged a 20% gratuity for purchasing a mini-can of Pringle's I served to myself.  No matter what it is you have on board you are charged 20% gratuity for it which guest relations will not deduct from your bill if you request them to do so.  In addition to that, Celebrity wants each passenger, not each stateroom, to pay a gratuity per day for being on their ship.  As far as excursions are concerned, the train trip at Ushuia ($189 pp) was horrible.  The tour guide made multiple mistakes boarding people onto the bus; and the bus driver was instructed to depart the pier 15 minutes prior to the scheduled departure, which was one reason why people had to be taken on and off of the bus multiple times before we got off of the pier.  The shore excursions desk was notified about this by many on the tour and we were offered a 30% discount on this tour.  If you want great cuisine while you cruise you have to pay additionally for it at a ""specialty"" restaurant.  Conclusion: Celebrity has several ways to maximize their profits while you're on board, and all of them are based on denying you quality.  For instance, the robes in our stateroom were filled with holes and were never changed once in 14 nights.  The bath linens are the poorest quality you could possibly supply to anyone; and the bath products (which were once by Gilchrist & Soames) are the very most basic form of acceptable. One called ""Lather"" didn't.  And the other called ""Shine"" dried out my hair.  And the ""sofa"" in the stateroom is nothing more than a bench without arms, covered in vinyl, with no cushions.  Underneath the sofa is a storage unit for life vests.  If you want to lounge in your stateroom without using the bed, forget it.  And on the balcony, the chairs when upright force you to look straight into the wood rail.  Never one time during the cruise did anyone ever clean the balcony floor or the glass. The stateroom lighting is horrible and we were never one time asked if their was anything we were in need of by our room attendant.",Sail Date: January 2020|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: South America|,

This ship is due for a refurbish in a few months but I found the accommodation comfortable, clean and good value for the cost.  I was delighted that the dining room had no problem accommodating gluten free and vegan dining requirements.  The main cafeteria clearly marked the gluten free offerings and I was in heaven chowing down on the gluten free desserts offered every day and desplayed in their own area!  The cafeteria manager was always available to answer my questions such as 'what was the gluten free sauce made out of' or 'are those corn tortillas cooked in separate oil?'  I ate at two specialty reastaurants on the ship; The Tuscan Grille and Sushi on 5.  Both accommodated my needs very well.  However, a word of caution on the sauces in the sushi restaurant...although the soy sauce offered was deemed gluten free, the containers all the soy sauces were in had no distinctive markings and I wondered how the kitchen kept them straight.  I declined to use any soy sauce as the kitchen could not produce the original bottles that listed the ingredients.  (Most soy sauce is brewed with wheat or barley for flavoring or color- be aware)   Overall, I ate well, comfortably and tastefully althought the offerings did get repetitive toward the end of this 15 day cruise.  Note; service in the main dining room during the second seating was very slow and orders were often incorrect.

We had beautiful sunny skies and the icebergs and snow-covered islands were stunning. It was so quiet and peaceful. It's had to imagine this large ship sailing past occasional pods of whales, or penguins playing on large icebergs that floated by. Our most southerly place was Paradise Bay which was partially covered with ice and icebergs. On land you could see many glaciers, but it was the quietness that really struck everyone on board. Next, we turned northeast and still had many days left that included a stop in the Falkland Islands and then northwest to Puerto Madryn, Argentina.

If you like relaxing sea days this is the cruise for you. Our friends had been to Hawaii a couple times at all exclusive resorts, but this was the first time for my wife and me.We have sailed with Celebrity Cruise line several times and have always enjoyed the experience. The Eclipse met all expectations. All of the staff went out of their way to make our cruise enjoyable. In my opinion, a great cruise occurs because of the cabin stewards and the waiters and The Eclipse has top of the line. By the second day our assistant waiter knew our names, the usual time we would show up for meals, and what hot drinks we would drink. Our room steward had ice for us in the morning after breakfast and in the evening after supper. If he was in the hall and saw us headed for our cabin, he would literally run to our door and open it for us.The entertainment on board was amazing. My wife and I took the backstage tour and was able to meet several of the performers and ask them questions. Since this was a cruise to Hawaii, two ambassadors from the islands was aboard to introduce us to Hawaiian culture. There was language, hula, and ukulele lessons passengers could take.The cruise made four stops in the islands. Hilo and Kona on the Big Island, Lahaina on Maui, and Honolulu on Oahu.At Hilo we rented a car. All the car rentals have free shuttles from the pier to their lots. We drove down to Volcanoes National Park and had lunch at Volcano Inn. Before we returned the car we visited Rainbow Falls. In Hilo, we did the Hop on/Hop off bus. The bus picks up at the pier and makes several stops to beaches, straw markets, shopping malls, and historical sites. Some of the best snorkeling is along the Kona shore. Do not forget to shop for coffee. At Lahaina, Maui we walked along the shopping area. Many souvenir shops, fine art stores, historical buildings, restaurants and bars. The old courthouse has many historical displays and public restrooms. One of the largest banyan trees in the world is located right next to the old courthouse.

Our first was with Disney.  I was a bit worried because Celebrity refurbishes their ships every 10 years and the Eclipse is due next year, so I thought the ship might be showing some wear.  However, I found the ship well maintained and the cruise quite pleasurable, despite the rainy weather the last half of the trip.We had a veranda stateroom on Deck 7.  The room was fine, although I did prefer Disney's split bath as opposed to Celebrity's all-in-one bathroom.  Our stateroom attendant Pascal was quite pleasant.  The Beverage Package we chose was the Classic Non-Alcoholic package, which includes sodas and non-premium bottled water.  We could have done without any package, as juices, coffee and tea are readily available, and just water would have been fine in the main dining room.  Staffers CONSTANTLY try to up-sell their beverage packages, much to our annoyance.  Before the cruise, we were inundated with emails trying to up-sell also--beverages, spa, internet, photos, excursions, etc.  Also annoying.We did not try any of the specialty restaurants with their extra charges and instead ate all dinners in the main dining room, Moonlight Sonata.  Meals were fine, but not exceptional.  Our main server Yvonne was stellar, and allowed us to order more than one dish each if we so wanted.  We had one lunch here (with lesser service), but did not breakfast here.  Our other meals were taken on Deck 14's Oceanview Cafe.  It gets CRAZY crowded here at times, with folks on the prowl for open tables.  The food was okay but plentiful, an all-you-can-eat buffet with a large variety of varying items for all meals.  The Cafe is open throughout the day serving breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner and late night.  We easily transitioned to 5 meals a day.We would also get a burger, hot dog, fries or soft-serve at the Mast Grill.The ship had an outdoor pool area plus an indoor Solarium pool for adults only.  On our rainy at-sea day, the Solarium was open to families for a few hours and was jammed packed.  We did not use the spa or fitness centre, although they looked nice when viewed on the ship tour we took.  We also took a Behind-the-Scenes ship tour, which is an excursion with a fee--very interesting.  We only saw one evening show, the Cirque Du Soleil-like show on the last evening.  We did attend a few presentations/lectures.  We saw but did not use the casino.  We saw the constantly rotating art gallery.Given the relentless schedule the crew must endure, it's no wonder sometimes the service was not friendly.  Still, a smile goes a long way.  The staff in the iLounge was particularly surly.  Our ports were: Sitka, Hubbard Glacier, Juneau and Ketchikan. The first two were highlights, as weather was great, and at Hubbard we boarded a smaller boat to get closer to the glacier.  Juneau and Ketchikan were nice but rainy.  In fact, what was supposed to be a highlight of our cruise, a helicopter/glacier/dog-sledding excursion in Juneau, was canceled due to the weather. Overall a pleasant experience.

We flew to Vancouver and stayed at the Pan Pacific, so our luggage was taken on board the cruise ship by the hotel staff, which made boarding easier. The boarding experience was the only really stressful part of the trip. We had to stand in line for over an hour while going through customs in a basement that reminded me of the film Children of Men. Once on board everything went really well. We had a Concierge Class balcony stateroom on deck 10. Room was great, nice view, no noise, promptly cleaned, and the crew is very friendly and customer service oriented. Our attendant Randy was amazing. Celebrity knows what they're doing. Everything was very well organized, clean, good looking. This is supposed to be for the ""younger"" crowd, but it was mostly older people. There were very few walker folks, Asian families bringing their buffet food in the elevator, a few Laughlin types in the casino, lotta British folks, some cheeky sods, some chavs, but all cool.  We had dinner with a British couple our age, and they were fun. She wore great rompers, and he was like a little Karl Pilkington-ish, but he probably smokes a little weed here and there and likes to party on the DL. Let's talk about the food. We had breakfast in the room, lunch in the dining room, and dinner in either the dining room or one of the specialty restaurants. Room service was the food with the largest profit margin, if you know what I mean. It was like Dennys. Lunch in the dining room is nice. So is dinner. We did Qsine one night with the ""holograms"" on the table. It was fun. Cocktails there were great. Sushi on 5 was bad. The 'lobster' ramen was one of the worst dishes I've come across. The service at dinner is really good. The wait staff is well trained and really cool. This was the last cruise of the Alaska season, and the weather was good for the first half, but it rained almost straight for the last four days. Our helicopter glaciar tour in Juno was cancelled, and so was our icy fjords float plane tour in Ketchikan. We had champagne on our balcony in front of the Hubbard Glacier and it's an experience to which photos do not do justice. We didn't shop on the ship. The ""art gallery"" on board was super-tacky. We had the classic beverage package and we didn't get our money's worth out of it. One or two nights we had enough booze, but we just don't drink that much. I refilled my water bottle out of the tap a few times. It was OK. The shopping in Alaska isn't that great. It's not Morocco. The 'native art' shops in Juneau all have the same stuff. We went to the local firing range and I emptied two mags with a UMP-45. That was cool. There was a store in Ketchikan, on the strip, to the left when you get off the ship, past the salmon place, it's an antique store. It's nice. Lots of nice carved walrus ivory, and many things that could easily be in a museum. I got two little totems. He had the best. It is a very well curated store. The owner really has a good eye. What else can I say? Use the Purell, they have dispensers all over the ship for a reason. I wouldn't describe it as crowded, but there are crowded moments. We had them take our luggage off the ship, that worked out cool. We spent our last night in Vancouver at the Fairmont. Just across the street from where you disembark. Overall it was a very nice experience, and I'll probably be cruising again. Oh yeah, and we saw some shows.

Once onboard, it was great to actually unpack our suitecases.  We were in an Aqua Class cabin - based on advice from my well 'cruised' cousin - as the best compromise of price & facility. It was an excellent choice.  The Blu restaurant was superb for breakfast and dinner,  excellent food and service. Lunch in the buffet 'Cafe' was less inspiring- very busy - though the food was good.This was only our 2nd ocean cruise, though we had done many European river cruises. Being a large ship we expected the entertainment to be pretty good - we were actually disappointed. The musical shows seemed a bit self-indulgent with no real story.The cruise itself was excellent with many whales seen on the voyage up and back.  The Hubbard Glacier was spectacular with perfect, though cold, weather. We saw lumps of ice falling and heard the 'thunder ' of the glacier grinding the rocks.Other excursions took in salmon 'running' upstream (but a week early for the bears catching them), a lumberjack show and whale/orca watching.

I opted to book a Sky Suite (the smallest and least expensive of the suite options) and that certainly made for a relaxing and luxurious vacation - especially considering I was travelling alone!  I loved my trip - it was certainly the most relaxing vacation I have ever had!Suite - I booked my suite through Costco.  I was guaranteed a Sky Suite at minimum, but as I didn't select a specific room the fare was considerably cheaper.  I ended up being assigned an accessible sky suite which proved to be very spacious.  There was no tub, but that didn't really matter to me.  Daisy (Butler) & Connie (Stateroom Attendant) were both extremely attentive.  My room was extremely clean upon arrival (I'm the type that looks behind and under the bed), and every day the room looked newly turned over!Dining - I opted to dine primarily in Luminae, the main dining room for suite guests.  All of the waitstaff (shout out to Dev) were great!  They remembered all of my preferences, made great recommendations, and made my solo dining experiences fun and relaxing.  The food was outstanding - and the couple times that I didn't seem thrilled with my selections Dev called me out on it and asked what else he could bring me!  I am not the sort to send food back or complain - he just noticed, and I really appreciated that.Ports - For the first port (Sitka) I made the mistake of thinking that i could fill my time by just exploring the town.  That took me all of 3 hours (including lunch), so I decided that for the remaining ports I would book excursions through Celebrity.  In Juneau I opted for the Sled Dog Summer Camp.  That was extremely enjoyable - we got to ride in a cart pulled by a sled dog team, visit with the dogs, and then hold some adorable Alaskan Husky puppies!Canyon Ranch Spa - On the first day I wandered over to the spa to check it out.  One of the massage therapists sat me down and gave me a mini shoulder massage as I looked at the menu.  Well done!

We approached the cruise with an open mind and a preparedness for most family summer holiday ,challenges’. We are also not people who seek out luxury and generally try to be cognizant of other holiday makers.The ship is enormous and very luxurious with different activities aimed at a broad range of interests. There is a healthy nightlife with many different activities ranging from casino to discos to theatre shows. We did not sample this side of cruise life preferring instead to play cards or chat as a family group who find it increasingly challenging to meet due to our wide geographical dispersion. I, for example, work in Europe while my 21 year old son is in Vancouver for the summer college recess and my partner and 6 year old daughter are living in another European capital.Through the day there is plenty to do. While we centered around the swimming pool I did attend an excellent and very well presented talk on climate change with emphasis on the effects on Alaska and its environment. There is also a library and shopping deck on board which provide a good service in both cases. The Gymnasium is well equipped with an adjacent Spa that is top class and which offers a healthy package of quality beauty and health treatments.The dining is superb with a highly professional and caring team at every level. We stuck to the main fare but there is a wide variety of high quality restaurants on board that will test the food critic. The food is always well presented and the dining room staff very professional. Particular compliments to Oscar from the Philippines who attended to us for the week.The ship docks at three Alaskan ports and there are a very good variety of tour packages available at every destination. In our case we opted for hiking and nature activities and were well satisfied with the these.The security on board is excellent. I work in this sector and was very impressed with the discrete professionalism that I saw, particularly at the port visits and at night on board.Without any doubt the greatest asset this cruise ship has is the crew who are true professionals who aim to please and are always very friendly and approachable regardless of hierarchy or problem. In our case a special thanks to Karla from Croatia who resolved a Banking issue in a very capable manner.If I had one reservation, without complaint, it is a suggestion that the facilities for younger children could be improved. I would suggest the addition of a small play area were parents could watch and be involved. In a similar vein the pitch and putt on the top deck could be improved from an equipment and visual perspective. I am cognizant that there are children’s play clubs on board but in our instance we did not wish to separate as the objective was to spend as much time as possible together.The concluding observation that I have is that there is a relaxed and professional ambience on board. Clients are treated with respect and there is a healthy diversity of activities on board to suit different tastes. The cruise duration of, in our case, one week is well tailored. Enjoy it and relax on the beautiful Ocean with spectacular views.",Sail Date: June 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: Family (young kids)|Destination: Alaska|,"Brussels, Belgium"

My first impression was The Prisoner (Patrick McGoohan) meets Butlins/Pontins holiday camp, which seem unkind, but it’s probably my sense of humour. I certainly warmed to it. Alaska was part of our plans for this holiday/vacation. To be honest, it didn’t disappoint. ALL of the crew we encountered at any time of the day/evening were polite, courteous and helpful. The food was excellent - the Ocean View Cafe offers an amazing array of foods. We chose to eat most of our breakfast and evening meals in the Moonlight restaurant - booking for dinner is recommended. We opted for the lower level drinks package. If you are a whiskey snob or wine connoisseur you may look at that differently. It worked for us. My only minor criticism would be that the coffee isn’t that good and it would be great if there were Danish pastries available in the afternoon! Embarkation was a bit of a faff, but efficient. Disembarkation is also efficient with taxis at the terminal. Trips: we pre booked trips via Celebrity. They were ok on the whole. I would suggest that one does research on what actually can be seen at the time of year one goes, since some things are seasonal. Fortunately for us, we saw bears whilst driving through the Rockies, but none on the trips off the cruise - or some other things. We did see whales (including from the ship) and a tour of the ‘behind the scenes’ ($ costs!) on the Eclipse is worthwhile. We saw dolphins from the shops bridge (that is not guaranteed!)",Sail Date: July 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Alaska|,"Stockport, United Kingdom"

It was really beautiful scenery all along the route and sailing up near the glacier was cool. The ship was nice in general. Our room was somewhat smaller than a normal hotel room but we had a balcony with enough room for both of us to sit and enjoy the views. The highlights were seeing the glacier, whales, and bald eagles. I enjoyed a couple of spa services, since some days at sea there was nothing to do. The vibe on the boat reminded me of Las Vegas, complete with a casino. It was a little crowded for me, especially at the pools. Breakfast was decent, in particular because they would deliver it for no extra cost. Lunch was generally gross and I didn’t like the big buffet restaurant at all. Dinners were reasonably good though. The service was very good except some mix ups on breakfast. The main issue I had with the cruise is they try to sell you stuff non-stop. Every port and every activity is filled with stuff they want to sell you. Turns out the cruise lines own a lot of the shops in town and they try to get you to go there. Everything is a constant up sell. The excursions are an expensive add on, but without them, you wouldn’t see much except souvenir shops. If I were doing it again, I would probably fly to Alaska and explore the areas I want to see in more depth. But, that said, we had a good time. I don’t know if I’ll be doing a cruise again anytime soon though.",Sail Date: June 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Alaska|,"San Francisco, California"

This was our first cruise on Celebrity Cruise Line. I went in with no real expectations. Check in was ok at Canada Place... it was very chaotic and the lines were long, but signs were clear, and they made sure you knew where to go next. I will say the check in staff was less than enthusiastic. They didn't smile or make conversation, and when we asked if our other cabin could be changed to a Veranda, the guy just shrugged and NEVER gave an answer either way... it was very strange. The ship itself is VERY dated.. I imagine 10 years ago it was AMAZING, I wish it had ben kept up. There were rails that had not been sanded in 10 years, viable rust everywhere you looked outside. it seemed clean... until you looked REAL close... it is clear it is due for some updating and TLC. The staff was fine. I would say they did their jobs... however, I never felt like they were ""happy"" about it, or trying to please the passengers. With the exception of our server and his assistant at dinner, the rest of the staff seemed to be just going through the motions.. which is fine, but let me feeling just lack luster about the whole experience. I LOVED the Sky Lounge ... it provided the BEST views from the inside and the cocktails were delicious up there. I also enjoyed the afternoon trivia and games.. however, MORE than a few times we tried to go to the Sky Lounge and it was closed for private events, which, I thought was not great considering it was always at prime times you would want to be in there... We traveled with our children 7 and 10 at the time. There is a ""Kids Club"". I will say, my kids REALLY enjoyed going to the club and hanging with kids their age... for my son there were about 5 other boys his age and 2 girls I think... and my daughter had about 8 other kids that were in there regularly. The staff was GREAT with the kids and while the activities may not be fancy like other cruises we have taken, they were VERY active and kept them busy and had LOTS of fun things to do throughout the day. Hours are limited, 9-12, 2-5, and 7-10... which is fine, but I found myself running them to and from all the time... I would hav liked a lunch time option where they could eat with friends etc.  Over all it was great for them and worked out allowing the adults in our party some adult time! The itinerary was fine. I loved Hubbard Glacier, if you can get the excursion to get up close.. DO IT. Sitka as boring and not much to do... we should have gone whale watching ... it is a walkable town so we walked to the Totem pole park and to the harbor and Downtown area... Juneau was great, We enjoyed the Glacier tour and then Salmon bake at Gold Creek... that was for sure the HIGHLIGHT, Darling place! Ketchikan was another cute city I wish we had arrived earlier, we got in at 2 PM, we went to the Lumberjack show and then a city ""Highlights"" tour... which turned into a LONG adventure to Potlatch Park.. if you are not in the mood to walk a park of Totem poles, skip the city tour, do the show and then walk around on your own, I wish we had done that. The tour guide was great, just was not what we were expecting. The food in the main dining areas was good. Taste and quality seemed better than most. The buffet was NOT GOOD... the variety was ok, but, it was lots of fried and bland and just not great. i did enjoy the made to order omelets. Coffee service is nice. Photo service was great. The cafe was nice. The Martini bar was great. The Sky Lounge was great, when available. The Worldclass Bar was nice, when it was open. I was VERY annoyed that they had no technology.... no app, no wave phones, they had NO way to contact us from the kids club, for example my son was feeling sea sick.. they had no way to get ahold of us.. we had no way to track available activities going on, or even contact the people traveling in our group. I feel like in 2019, this should b STANDARD on ALL CRUISE ships. The cabins were larger than I anticipated, we had a veranda and my mom traveling with us had an inside cabin, my son stayed with her and it was VERY large and very nice. Overall I thought it was a great vacation, I do not feel like Celebrity went above and beyond to make it the BEST VACATION ever. They provided what we needed, they were safe and we enjoyed our time as a family. I would have liked more from the staff I guess, but, it was fine for what we paid and expected. I would recommend Celebrity Eclipse for a good vacation.I should also mention you are able to ""pre Book"" tastings and onboard activities, HOWEVER, other than specialty dining, you get NO information regarding those tastings... no time, no location, no date.. NOTHING, it was very vague... so, it turns out, You must go to guest relations and find out When and where, and even then they are Never really Sure when or where... and for the Martini Flight and Flare show.. you just go ""Any time"" the Martini bar is open, even though they offer it at 5 PM ... which was weird because kids club closes at 5PM so it was very confusing when we could participate. We ended up doing the Martini Flight the last night after kids went to kids club at 7pm, which threw the bar team off and we had to go get a copy of our receipt etc etc... which took FOREVER ... so why didnt they give us tickets if we needed proof we paid... it should have been somehow attached to our room account or key card or whatever... the way they did that stuff was PAINFUL and totally NOT worth it! You can purchase it on board if you want to participate!",Sail Date: June 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Family (multi-generational)|Destination: Alaska|,"Gilbert, Arizona"

If you want superior luxury high class restaurant is also available but not free. The cruise environment is marvelous you feel like you’re in the paradise. The young captain and his crews were extraordinary charming I’ve never seen like that before and all are helpful. The theater activities were delightful (I always look forward to watch the show never missed a single day). The entire journey including shore excursion was excellent.

I think this route is better, you can see the glacier in a close distance and even spot whales from your balcony. Everything is good, except the spa with hot stone bed and sauna is much smaller and less choice than we would like. Last time we were on Norwegian Escape, it's so relaxing with the massage pool, hot stone bed, 3 kinds of sauna, steam room and panoramic view at the back of the ship. One happy surprise is the 'Taste of Alaska' dinner we signed up for at the Qsine restaurant. There are so many food, you can ask for more if you want, food taste good and fresh.

Wish we had as it would have worked out cheaper!We were very disappointed with the wild life commentary. We had expected much more than the vague, jokey and unapproachable host who gave the impression that he had better things do. In fact in one of his presentations a Korean lady got up saying she had expected a talk on wildlife which he dismissed by pretending to not understand her. In fact he ridiculed the fact that she was leaving! We were disgusted by this flippant approach and not at all impressed. We have been on trips in New Zealand with very enthusiastic wild life experts and were expecting something similar.  Obviously Celebrity don't believe that is what their guests want.

The entertainment was good however we thought it was a little dated and very limited. No deck 14 parties and best night was the silent disco !.

I'll be sailing her again in a couple of years in Hawaii.We boarded in Buenos Aires. This was where everything we'd heard about how Argentina does business came true. Fortunately this didn't reflect on the ship. But if you get beeped by the metal detector, expect to be dealt with by a bunch of confused people in uniform who only know Spanish. I had transferred all my magstripe cards to a bundle secured in my backpack so my wallet only contained a bare minimum. This was the least obvious thing to trigger the beep I've ever had.Once we were aboard we had our first lunch in the Luminae restaurant, which is the standard restaurant for sky suite and above. The waiters, sommelier, hostess, maitre'd were all pleasant and we were sad when they disembarked a day early at Montevideo.All the meals were wonderful. We dined at most of the specialty restaurants: Murano, Tuscan Grill, Qsine. At Qsine they only had Le Petit Chef, an animated set of characters projected from above onto your plate and place, which was an amusing gimmick to accompany a decent meal. One of our Murano nights was ""Chef's Table"" which was not outstanding on the dining level. It is very hard to objectively rate any of the dining rooms when we had a great squad of friends and acquaintances to dine with at all of them. I would say that Chef's Table and Le Petit Chef were not value for money. They were interesting experiences. Chef's Table includes a tour of the galleys and someone from the staff joins your table.Our cabin was not an amazingly modern beautiful place, it was homey and comfortable. We had booked a Sky Suite, but at the last minute we had the chance to upgrade to a Celebrity Suite for extremely minimal ducats. We took this chance and we ecstatically enjoyed the result. We also had the chance to bid on a move-up to higher suite categories but the minimum bid was too high and the other factors didn't balance out. In the Celebrity Suite there is a translucent panel in the wall that separates the bedroom from the sitting room. This allows natural light to come in and we found it a plus. Our real destination was Antarctica and it was quite a sight. There are many things that come down to luck from this trip, and not so much from Celebrity operations. All the weather was fantastic, so we got where we were going on time, without missing ports. Drake's Passage had a tiny bit of drama: A couple of waves crashed on the ship above the level of the Luminae's windows. But the ride was among the smoothest we've had which is either the weather or the stabilizers. Once we were in Gerlache Strait the water was extremely smooth.

But a couple small items left room for improvement. Upon arrival to our stateroom, we found that we could not change the TV channel, or turn it off. We told the stateroom attendant and he said he would have it fixed. 6 hours later (10pm) we found the TV still not fixed. I called guest services and told them and they said they would send someone immediately. So I laid down in a not so comfortably position in anticipation of arrival at my door, someone to fix the TV. No-one came and we had to sleep all night with the TV on (no sound, but no darkness either). By noon the next day it still wasn't fixed, so I went in person to guest services and reported the situation. They gave me a new set of batteries to try in the remote - presto, upon opening the remote I discovered there were no batteries in the remote. Installed the batteries and everything fixed by me, not the cruise staff.Next problem was amount of on-board spending. My paperwork prior to the cruise said I had $150 on-board spending. The 2nd day, I received a card saying I had $50 on-board spending. I went to guest services and asked if it was additional OB $ or what.  They said it was from my vacation planner, however it wasn't showing up on my account - it only showed the 150. I was of the belief that the 150 was from Celebrity and the 50 was from the vacation planner I booked with. They told me to check back the next day as sometimes it takes a little time for it to show up on your account.  The next day it still showed 150 and they said it was a mistake that numerous people had on their accounts and that 150 was the total. I am not convinced of that.This was a 12 day cruise and they wanted $49.95 to wash and dry one bag of clothes, which we thought was totally too much, so my wife washed a couple items in the sink and hung up in the shower. Now that we are back from the cruise I looked to see when we would reach the next level of benefits and found that we were allowed one bag of wash on the cruise that we just went on because it was a 12 day cruise.

The adjoining room is flip-flopped so there bed is on the opposite side and end of the room from yours (clever).  Bathroom storage was great.  Storage in the room was about average for inside cabins.  It was fairly spacious for an inside cabin with a full length sofa in the sitting area.  The buffet area was well laid out with various food stations so people were fairly spread out as they gathered their meals.  I had food that was barely warm several times which was disappointing.  In the dining room food service was slow.  Our room attendant was superb however!  This was a repositioning cruise - so the price was excellent.",Sail Date: April 2019|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Canada|,"San Diego, California"

The food was not spectacular on that trip but the ports/excursions/service...etc. were so great that we decided to do the Argentina/Chile cruise on Eclipse. What a difference! First of all, there is such a lack of leadership on this cruise. Managers couldn't be bothered to do their employees work because they are managers, duh! They couldn't be bothered even if guests were waiting for food/ a place to sit...etc.Furthermore, the excursions weren't great and since we weren't able to get down in Puerto Madryn that meant that a lot of passengers weren't able to see penguins. So of course, everyone wanted to go on a penguin excursion in Punta Arenas and the shore excursion people did NOTHING to make it happen. What's the point of doing an Argentina cruise, where EVERYONE wants to see penguins, and not be able to see any? I was beyond disappointed.Also a disappointment? The tenders! At both ports we were able to get down, they only had a maximum of 4 tenders working! I bet you can imagine the long lines to get onto tenders once excursions were over. It was craziness. Our cruise room's AC didn't work and it took us 10 phone calls to finally get someone up to the room. They ""fixed"" it... it only blew a bit of cold air, not enough to sleep comfy.The sheets had a weird smell to them. And we always found hairs on our sheets and towels. Furthermore, our attendant, made the bed for the next cruisers while we were still checked in the room (unsanitary, anyone?). They also reuse the throw and the decorative pillows, despite them being put on the floor. Of course, with that being said, there were some employees that were beyond special, and I give the cruise 3 starts because of them.We are hoping our next cruise with Holland America is as great as our last trip with the company because, if it is, we are sticking with HA.

Had people lined up for hours waiting to be processed. There was no place for anyone to sit. Other cruise lines issue a number and have passengers sit to wait for their number to be called. The gangplank to the ship was very steep so the staff had to strain to push wheelchair passengers on the ship.Room 9402 very nice and good location, efficient room design with the exception of no electric plug next to or near bed. I called Crucon prior to sailing and requested distilled water for a piece of medical equipment. It was not there. I am sure that there are many people who use a CPAP machine at this present time. Our room attendant Kam, came and introduced himself. He was pleasant and carried out requests. There were no extra special touches in the room, ie cotton buds, shower caps, razors or emery boards  in fact you could not even purchase an emery board aboard the ship. There was only soap, shampoo, conditioner and lotion. We were not served a complimentary bottle of champagne as we were served on prior cruises,We had to ask for ice to be present in our room in the evening. There is no folder in the room to describe anything about the ship or contain a list of room service foods. I still don't know if room service is available for meals other than breakfast. There was a sheet for us to fill out every evening for breakfast. We had coffee in our room every day and twice they delivered without cups and milk. The towels and sheets had a funky unpleasant odor, perhaps it was their detergent or not enough detergent.  The air conditioner/heat control was not predictable, one time it would be very cold on a setting and the next time it would be uncomfortable at that same setting. The room would become warm while we were in port. The bed was not wonderful, there was no pillow top softness but I am like the princess and the pea. The pillows were OK. Trip route- It was a relocation cruise and the stops were not earth shaking. The prices for ship trips to essentially nothing locations were very expensive. We only did two trips, one to Lima and the other in Punta Arenas Costa Rica. Both were interesting. The other ports did not have anything that looked like we needed to explore further or sounded uninteresting.  Entertainment- Stale and according to passengers who previously sailed on the ship it was a repeat of the same performances. The songs were dull and uninspiring. The entertainment was aimed at old people and I am older than god. They need to update their performances. The Eclipse Orchestra was the highlight of the performances. They need to continue with “Live Orchestras” not a digital replacement that is being contemplate by the company. All of our table mates refused to attend the performances because of them being so boring and repetitive.Service-The staff were very positive, smiling and caring throughout the ship.  The Captain was a pseudo comedian. Alejandro the master of ceremony was great. Jose P and Edwin our staff in the dining room were caring and attentive they get a 10 out of 10!Food- Terrible!!On previous trips the many tasty main courses offered were wonderful, one had to make a decision of choosing from all the very appealing meals offered most every evening. On this cruise trying to find even one was a difficult task, in fact there were many nights we only had appetizers for our meal because the selection was so poor.  On the dress up nights there was nothing special offered except on the last dress up night and another regular evening soft shell lobster not New England lobster. The breakfast and lunch buffets were OK. The salad dressing were horrible. There were people stationed at the entry of cafeteria dispensing hand sanitizing solution but there are no hand washing places there. Hand washing is the only way to truly prevent novovirus. Passengers complained that there was a respiratory illness spreading aboard the ship toward the end of the cruise. Disembarkation-A nightmare! Directions printed for passengers to follow were not written by an English speaking person and were very confusing. Other passengers stated the same regarding the poorly written directions. No one knew where they were to go or wait. There were lines all over the ship. Exiting from the ship was down a very steep gangplank. If I had my luggage I would have been propelled down the gangplank. Being in a wheelchair would have been very scary. SummaryWe are not gung-ho cruisers but have enjoyed our previous 7 cruises because the food was outstanding, the entertainment fun, but this trip left a bad taste in our mouth. I am not sure we will cruise again anytime soon. Is Celebrity trying to drive people do the specialty dining?? I refuse to pay additional money that probably amount to $100+ for each night to get a decent meal. If this is their object the staff will be shortchanged and service will suffer. The staff in the dining room depend on their tips to supplement their income.",Sail Date: March 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: South America|,"Helotes, Texas"

I won’t go deep into details but after spending about $24,000 for the “Outrageous Outback” 14-day cruise, despite advertising “free” internet, they refused to remove an internet charge of $139.88. The management motto must be collect as much money as you can, provide no customer service. Another passenger we befriended was charged $327 on the first night for a doctor visit due to sea sickness. We left Sydney with high winds and very rough seas and zero warning from the captain as to what the night would be like and thus no ability to premedicate. The ship management would not even acknowledge any responsibility and refused to remove that charge. We should have know things would be like this based on very rude and dismissive responses to our concern on the part of the Miami staff about not receiving our documents before leaving. They were returned to Miami after they were sent to an old address we left three years before the cruise. They blamed that on us saying we had ample time to review our information. This is despite us never providing that information but in their system probably related to an old correspondence. What happened to the adage the “customer is always right”. Based on my experience, I know Oceania’s response to this review will be to blame us for everything. I will NEVER sail with them again, never, even if free. The service on the ship was the opposite. The working staff were excellent but paid like slaves and the management actually refers to the gratuities that they add to our bill as the staff’s “salary”. The fish rots from the head down.

They were genuinely concerned about my health when I got sick and were trying to get me to eat something to keep my strength up.  The entertainment was good.

No carpet scuffs, no stains - in fact the entire ship was in tip top condition. Our veranda cabin was comfy - the bathroom though is tiny. Keep this in mind if you have mobility problems. This is one of  eight R class ships constructed from 1998. Home to just 800 pax it is small enough to sneak into small harbours and getting on/off is always simple. Unlike Azamara, another operator of this class of ship, alcoholic drinks are not included in the fare which can really bump up the bill at the end of your cruise. We booked a concierge level balcony cabin - I am used to the concierge club on RCL. However when I went to reception to find the lounge on Regatta I was told ""we don't have one."" We were supposed to get special privileges including room service from the grand dining room menu - not that I ever saw a copy in the cabin. We did get a bag of laundry done - we were offered up to three. Gratuities are supposed to be included - but we were both slugged $US224 on the final bill. Confusing really - Consumer Affairs here will have fun as the ship is heading to Australia. The food was splendid - as an ultimate compliment to the chef, pax preferred the grand dining room to the specialty restaurants. I should add you pay a whopping 18 per cent US on every drink you buy - booze is obviously a key to the profitability of Oceania.

While the ship itself is not my favorite, the itinerary included many small ports that the larger ships don't access, and that's what made this trip very enjoyable.  Regatta is going into dry dock in September for a much needed refurbishment, especially to the staterooms.  This cruise line caters to an older clientele (even older than Princess), I would say the average age is 70+.  Many of the passengers were mobility limited, not necessarily in wheelchairs but many seemed to have difficulty getting around.  That's why a smaller ship is probably more appealing to them - easier to navigate.  That being said, the entertainment options were very limited and definitely geared toward the elderly.  Much of the pre-dinner audience listening to the ""Gloria String Quartet""  was asleep in their chairs.  I'm 58 and was one of the youngest passengers.  I personally prefer a ship with more entertainment that's a bit more contemporary (even the obligatory Beatles cover band would have been too rowdy for this crowd) such as Royal Caribbean.   And the house production crew, while good, were only 4 singers putting on a 45 minute singing show.  Yes they were good, as was the cruise director who did his best with a limited arsenal of venues and entertainers.  To explain why I give this ship a 2 for Value:  it was not a good match for me, again, the ship and this cruise line skew much too old for me.  I couldn't see paying almost twice as much than for Royal Caribbean (whose food is quite good).  Also, the excursions were WAY too expensive - most were at least $200 per person, some even $400+.  I was able to save anywhere from $65 - $100 per person booking the identical excursions on my own either through Viator or other independent tour operator.  I will never book excursions via the ship (whatever the cruise line) again - lesson learned!The best value was the 2 for 1 Happy Hour drinks from 5-6 every night.

Our cabin was always very well maintained, by the attentive cabin stewards. The food was exceptional. As with any cruise the quantity is off the charts. Always excellently prepared and presented. The shipboard entertainment was age-appropriate and very well selected. I must add one of our most appreciated traits of sailing on the Oceania Regatta is the decorum of the fellow cruisers. The age is generally what one often refers to as ""senior citizen"" category. Always well behaved, with very pleasing manners. Nearly a stately, without the haughtiness, demeanor amongst our fellow cruisers.

You can't see the shore excursions until you book and after booking we discovered there were no snorkeling or activity-based excursions anywhere, in Hawaii, Mexico or Central America, nothing. We had sailed Oceania 4 times previous and always had snorkeling and physical activity excursions from which to choose, and this time nothing, just guided tours in large groups. Things went wrong from the beginning on departure day, from our delayed boarding to bags not being delivered to rooms. The delayed boarding was because they had to clean the ship, which resulted in us having to checkout of our hotel and walk around with luggage for two hours before finally boarding but not having bags delivered to our rooms because the ground crew hired by Oceania took a 2 hour siesta mid-day from loading a ship boarding day. I had a medical device in my bags which I needed and left me in a bad way. I had never experienced a delay in bag delivery on Oceania before, or I would have hand-carried my device. The ship did apologize and delivered a bottle of wine to compensate me for my distress. The on board activities were those best relegated to an assisted living facility, it was miserable and boring. Because a passenger got sick we had to double back to Hawaii and lost 24 hours off our schedule which resulted in loss of ports scheduled for this cruise. Instead of stopping at Cabo as scheduled the ship elected to skip Cabo and go to Acapulco, a city which the State Department had been sending me emails warning not to go while I was onboard. There were no warnings about going to Cabo, yet that was one of the ports they chose to skip. Many passengers had planned to meet family members in the ports we skipped and there was no recourse for them. Then my husband got bronchitis, so we went to the ship's doctor. This was the biggest mistake we made. Stateside he would have been given antibiotics and told to rest for a couple of days. Instead, this ship's doctor insisted on administering IV Cipro over a period of three days, leaving the port open in his arm for 72 hours, and quarantined both of us to our room. The bill was over four thousand dollars, and you have to pay cash on board. (we eventually got reimbursed by travel insurance many months later). The medical treatment and choice of antibiotics used were inappropriate. To compensate passengers for the loss of so many ports, the ship offered free alcohol for a two hour period one evening. It seems that alcohol is their apology of choice. The food was good but menus were repetitive and I went more than once to get a milkshake at the outdoor grill but all they were able to make was thin chocolate milk, but they called it a milkshake. We truthfully couldn't wait to get off this ship having spent so many sea days with so little to do. We had been cruising for years but after this experience have decided to stop cruising because of the questionable medical care you might get, the inability to see what the shore excursions will be prior to booking, and no recourse or compensation if the company decides to change the itinerary once you are aboard.",Sail Date: May 2018|Cabin Type: Suite|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Cuba|,"Globe, Arizona"

It is doubtful if we and our group will patronize Oceania again because we did not receive a premium cruise line ship nor product and the negative specifics of this cruise as noted below sealed our decision.To summarize: 1) Cancelled ports before we left the dock in San Fran. We had 2 cancelled ports, 1 port reduced to 2 hrs before darkness and 1 port swap. Guests were provided minimal information on the reasons why quickly dying Sergio had such an impact on our itinerary - other than the Captain saying there is a tropical storm. San Diego was swapped for Cabo. Missed Nicaragua and El Salvador. Supposed to be in Puntarenas at 11 but arrived at 3. Were told tides were a problem there. We actually arrived 1.5 hrs before the lowest tide. The tide is 1 metre there. We believe that the tide excuse was a lie. We found out that the ship had to be at this port because staff were flying to Miami. They created 2 tours there both of which had the last 1 hour in total darkness. So they put their corporate requirements ahead of giving the passengers a real port day. There is a history of mechanical issues with Regatta as previously posted on CC (see below). There are also CC Oceania regulars who note Oceania has a history of missing and shortening ports.Bottom line - slowed down for 1 day to allow the storm to pass but missed 3 days of ports. The math does not work in Oceania’s favor. 2) No attempt to reinstate some ports given that Sergio moved across the Baja very quickly - many on the ship monitored NOAA so we were very much aware of the situation. Ship management never explained why we could not make another port. Total silence. 3) Number 2) then contributed to 3). On the pacific side, why was the ship going 15.3 knots for long periods of time? The ship is capable of a higher speed, why was it not engaged to reinstate a port? 4) On the Atlantic side, suddenly the ship was doing 20.9 knots. Why was this speed not available on the Pacific side? ie 2) and 3) above. The speed differential on the different sides set myself and the passengers into further disillusionment. 5) Water, Toilet, Power Disruptions - Lights were flashing from time to time, power was out 1 night at 2am, repeated toilet malfunction throughout the ship. Water was luke warm most of the time in the bathroom sink. No cold water in the bathroom. 6) Treatment of Guests. Guest relations was swamped with guests asking for information, return of port fees, more information on why the port cancellations, the unsatisfactory and unsafe tour buses in Acapulco, the poor tour in Puntarenas etc. Regatta management searched out guests who went to guest relations (particularly those requesting return of port fees and why no attempt to reinstate a port) and forced them to meet with the General Manager and other managers. In some cases there was 1 guest to 3 management. Guests were intimidated into signing paperwork to cease talking to guests, (myself included). If we did not sign, would be consequences. The defensiveness of the Regatta management was very overt. For 3 nights, Ray the CD, was booed in the Regatta show room. Some of the guests forced a meeting with the Captain. 7) Decline of food quality. Post the new menu in August 2018, the food size, quality, appearance, variety in the GDR and the Terrace had declined since my last trip in Sept 2017. All meat was tougher and portions smaller. Something was off, there was so little taste to anything even when labeled as Cajun. Quality examples – salads swimming in mayonnaise, bean salad in the GDR was 3 types of canned beans with 2 sliced onion rings, no dressing, no taste. A salad had the white/pale yellow insides of an iceberg lettuce with 3 pieces of blue cheese and 2 walnuts that is it. A very noticeable cut back were the high tea sandwiches – much higher % of white bread, less ingredients and decoration, less seafood fillings – and, a number of them were frozen, not cold. A couple at the next table took the frozen sandwiches down to guest relations to complain. They came back to their table and told guests that they were dismissed. There was some repeats given the voyage was 18 days. Thinking about Oceania's marketing ""finest cuisine at sea"" - did not end my trip with that impression. The food on this trip was similar to my mass cruise line experiences, with the exception of the specialties which were better.8) The Ship and Cabin. A small ship with considerable movement in only 6 foot waves – would never book this type of ship again, found the movement actually dangerous. Given it is 20 years old it shows decent maintenance. As often reported of all the R ships of Oceania and Azamara, the small size of the bathroom and cabin size is not appropriate for a premium cruise line. A negative is also the balcony dividers, the dividers had a 2 inch opening against the hull so you really did not have privacy. 9) Shore Excursions. In Acapulco, the 12 person size tour van were unsafe. The seat belts did not work, there were no headrests and there was no A/C for the back half of the bus. Guests in the back left the excursion half way through. There was no pa system on the van, so the driver was constantly during towards the back to yell information - this often while driving!. The tour was good though seeing all the highlights and viewpoints. The vans were not premium quality as should be the case given this was an Oceania cruise. I and others were scared the entire time the van was moving. On to Puntarenas. As noted above, we were very late arriving. Only 2 hours to darkness. They put together two tours - one a brief area tour and shopping and one for a horse show. Our friends did the shopping tour. The bus was not well equipped and the last hour was driving in the dark. There was a very large lineup at guest relations and shore excursions thereafter. On the positive side: 10) Staff/Crew - simply outstanding in every regard. Their smiles, salutations, work ethic, friendliness and engagement a 10/10. All the staff, everyone, was great. The room stewardess and steward were wonderful and kept our cabin spotless and in order. The service was at a premium level. Unlike Celebrity who used to have pool wait staff, Oceania does and they also provide glasses of iced water on a regular basis. The service level was at the premium category.11) Cabin 7047. Concierge. Excellent mid ship location. Quiet, no mechanical sounds and no operational rooms across from the cabin. 12) Other – Very good specialty restaurants with significant menu choice, a real high tea every day, a real Sunday brunch with ice carvings etc just like the old days, excellent live music aboard, excellent soundtracks and volume level, the breads were divine, port lectures good. The Oceania mattress was excellent.13) No ship within a ship – everyone on Oceania ships mingle together and eat together and enjoy the same level of service. There is no overt class segmentation which isolates guests from each other like on the mass lines. There were many guests I spoke to who were on Oceania and Viking and Crystal because they refuse to sail on the mass cruise line ships that promote physical class segmentation. This is a major reason I have sailed with Oceania.14) No mass market shrilling for sales, photo sales, painting sales etc. It was delightful to not have the mass market intrusive revenue generating experience.15) Appropriate entertainment. The Oceania orchestra was excellent and very personable. ""Grace"" the string group were super especially their rendition of Michael Jackson's Thriller. The type of music like 60's and 70's songs, Broadway theme songs complimented the passenger profile. There were no Vegas style shows. Bottom line on this trip, the premium quality was not there and there was no trust in Oceania ship management and corporate.Like my household, many guests booked this cruise for the birding and naturalist opportunities to be provided in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador - all were eliminated. I and others, ended up not trusting Oceania's explanation of why our itinerary was adjusted to such a significant degree. Everyone was aware of dying tropical storm Sergio. Perhaps a more customer friendly and detailed explanation of the impacts of the storm might have enabled guests to understand and accept the significant changes. It seemed that Oceania was not interested in working hard to reinstate a port for the benefit of the guests. The ship was plodding along at below 16 knots for many days, we do wonder why an original port, or another port of many along the Pacific side, could not have been reinstated since the ship can sail in excess of 18 knots. As well, there were guests who were well aware of Regatta's past mechanical history in the past year. This information became common knowledge on the ship. Some of these mechanical issues have previously been reported on CC. November 7, 2017 being towed by the Coast Guard into Honolulu after being dead in the water with no power. May 2018, delayed in Cartagena awaiting parts. On the Alaska cruise just before this one, the ship missed Juneau and again was dead in the water for hours. Other than the excellent service and excellent specialty restaurants, Oceania’s product was not better than other mass market cruises. One of the most telling experiences on this voyage was on the last day. By the pool, groups of guests were completing their questionnaires. People were talking and sharing their forms with the general comments being “cruise from hell”, “poor value”, “don’t trust them”, “food really declined” etc. People were angry. The group of 12 guests close to my chaise lounge were competing to see who could produce the most negative rating. In the end, Oceania management's aggressive response to guest questions told me they had something to hide.",Sail Date: October 2018|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Central America|,"Ottawa, Canada"

We stayed in BS319 (balcony suite 319) on the deck 5, though it is my understanding this vessel will be going in for a complete overhaul and I'd imagine the room numbers will change.  While the ship was dated, the service and attention we got from the crew members was outstanding, so we didn't care.  Everything was clean, and well attended.  Our room attendant, ""Matt"" was excellent, and I hope the president of Wind Star cruises reads this review and gives him a bit fat raise.  He represents this company well and because of him and other crew members, we will definitely consider cruising Wind Star again.  This was a smaller ship, just over 200 passengers.

The on board experience is very much as you would wish BUT when trying to get a response to a query or problem off the ship the words “blood” and “stone” come to mind.We completed a very enjoyable 24 day cruise Singapore to Sydney on 21 Dec. Our last afternoon and evening were spoilt by apparent breaches of Port Protocol and after arriving home mysterious items on our on board Account showed up. Our immediate attempts raise and question both these met silence, even allowing for the Christmas break. Our (Virtuoso) Travel Agent after persisting was told our complaint and query had been “passed onward”. She did obtain for us a copy of our account which neither showed nor solved anything.Since then the only communications from Seabourn have been survey requests and automated emails telling us how much they value us !! Oh Really ?Over several years we have sailed 140 days with Seabourn and although this is not the first time Admin have frustrated us - they cancelled our Golden Wedding cruise and took took 4 months to refund -  we do enjoy the on board experience so we gave them another chance. In fact before the debacle on the last day of this trip we had even booked another cruise. Needless to say this has now been cancelled. enough is enough.So while there’s little doubt you would enjoy a Seabourn cruise just hope that nothing goes wrong which can’t be dealt with on board.

Not so. There was never a need for more than trousers and a neat polo shirt at lunch and for a long-sleeved shirt and trousers at dinner.

On those other lines the excursions were great, we were not impressed with the food or service.  Seabourn had recently hired a new chef for the pool deck evening dining venue - called Earth and Sea.  Phenomenal food.  Better than any restaurant we have in Seattle or anywhere else.  After trying the other dining choices, all of which were good, we ended up eating at Earth and Sea every night.  By the end of the cruise word had spread, and it was hard to get a table there.  We weren’t impressed with the Thomas Keller dining room…oddly pretentious and mediocre food.  They do offer exceptional wine by the glass and wine pairings at Keller, which is a nice addition.  We had a much better steak at Earth and Sea.  The cruise director was very entertaining and engaging.  The staff was warm and attentive.  The ship is beautiful - with staterooms larger than the ones on their former smaller ships.  Most, but not all, of the land excursions were very good.  Seabourn didn't offer an opportunity to rate the land excursions that the other cruise lines do.  I think that's a missed opportunity to get valuable feedback, particularly where passenger safety is concerned.

This cruise experience had all the elements of why people are down on the cruise concept. Last reservation to have dinner is at 8:30 so if you’re late from a ship sponsored excursion, you’re out of luck and eat room service. Room service menu is bland and boring and the same items every night.Everything on this ship is based on their schedule  and not the guests. I ordered coffee one morning and after 40 minutes, I went upstairs to get my own. It turns out the person who makes the coffee drinks is the same person who would deliver it to for room service so if the coffee area is busy, you will not get coffee in your room. The deck area was always crowded and not enough space for everyone.. it also occurred to me that they are understaffed in all the positions. We had to wait for a table for dinner unless we got there by 6:00PM.They also run out of the food specials if you eat later than 7:30. After the second day at sea, they ran out of the top shelf alcohol and substituted cheaper brands. The music and entertainment is all geared toward a very old crowd.

He is enthusiastic, energetic and clearly does whatever is necessary to ensure everyone is having a good time. This particular itinerary left from Monaco and ended in Barcelona 10 days later. It was pure bliss, very relaxing and invigorating. The Seabourn flightease program has always been able to beat the cost of any airfare I've tried to arrange independently so I regularly use them now.

So you get up close and personal with them all really.Food and accommodations are always excellent although we had a noise issue above us in suite 1013 (they are all suites by the way) and they moved us up to a Penthouse suite.  VERY nice.  Thankfully there was a spare room!!  Pretty sure that suite was a known noise problem (the Observation Bar galley is directly above) but they handled it well and moving was made easy since they did 90% of it.We have cruised with Holland America, Celebrity and Cunard and they all have their plus points but for us the intimacy and service on a SB ship is streaks ahead of the the others; hence we keep going back.This 16 day trip around NZ involved, Auckland, Waiheke Island, the Bay of Islands, Norfolk Island (Australia) Milford, Dusky & Doubtful Sounds cruising, Stewart Island, Dunedin, Akaroa, Kaikoura, Wellington, Gisborne, Napier, Tauranga and Auckland.Sadly the weather conditions for Norfolk meant we couldn't get ashore and also the Sounds were canned too as it was rough down there as well but everywhere else was as per the itinerary - great!Ticked a few more off the bucket list with whale watching in Kaikoura and stingray feeding in Gisborne the highlights.  Having said that feeding Albatross' off Stewart Island, visiting the Lord of the Rings/Weta Workshop in Wellington, shopping with the Chef in Napier and eating/learning how to cook at the Akaroa Cooking School were all pretty awesome too!Fabulous ship, crew, food, locations, etc.  Must book another one soon!!

They take your money and don't issue a receipt.  Book you flights that arrive late at night and a hotel that shuts at 10.00pm - in Melbourne in the pouring rain and having to find a hotel!!No details or information regarding the booking unless asked for.  Spent one hour on ""hold"" to customer service.The QE - might be ok for a cruise with no sea days but didn't suit us otherwise.  It might have done if we'd been around 80 years old - which is the average.  For some reason it attracts lots of sick people.  There was plenty of entertainment but we were killing time only as it was mostly aimed at elderly travellers.  The fine dining restaurant was ok but the buffet restaurant leaves a lot to be desired - food barely warm and unattractive and the unhygienic habits of some of the occupants left a lot to be desired.  Afternoon tea was the best.  Cabin was a good size and steward was impressive.  Drinks package, which included soft drinks, fancy teas and coffees plus alcohol was a ridiculous price, made even more so because all cabin occupants had to have it if one did.  We took our own alcohol but indulged in the odd cup of coffee and coke - at a very ridiculous price.  We paid extra to have lunch in the Verandah restaurant and wished we hadn't bothered - except they do a wonderful bread!!  We have done two other cruises, both 5 star, so pls believe me, when Cunard markets themselves as ""luxury"" they are delusional.  You do get what you pay for, however, it was clean.  Our cabin was just on the edge of midships - we were lucky - anything at the front, back or high up offered a very rocky ride.  If you must do it choose the cheapest option and it might represent value for money.

Drinks were so overpriced $7.50 for a Glass of Soft Drink,  in the Lido Restaurant (the Buffet) where the food was great with freshness and great choice but no one ever asked us for a drink. Sitting around the pool again no one asked us for a drink, And other times when we were spoken too we were spoken to like children, No communication, had to chase up my own final Bill, had to chase up my own disembarkation time and location.

Also, we are not without our ailments.  My husband is permanently disabled with a brace on his leg and walking stick.  I am on dialysis and I follow a gluten-free diet.  All things considered, we are still pretty active.  As an example, my favourite part of the cruise was walking around the outside deck in the wind and rain.  The air was fresh and it was really invigorating.  I did that 3-4 times a day and really enjoyed it.  The passengers I met while doing this were really lovely. We decided to do the short cruise from Melbourne to Sydney in luxury to get a feel for life at sea.  We had a Queens Grill(Q1 Suite) which is evidently supposed to be the best of the best.  Turns out I should have done my home work better.  Considering it was the best of the best it was at the stern of the ship and I have learnt from other passengers since being on board - only stay mid-ship.  Good advice I could have done with whilst booking.  Considering it was $5,000 for less than 36 hours you would expect a relatively comfortable ride.  It was far from that.  The vibration was shocking, lots of noise and everything in the suite rattled.  It looked nice but it was really uncomfortable and the lights even flickered with the vibration.  Neither my husband or I slept at all the first night.  Let's start at the beginning.  Booking and subsequent contact with Cunard was a nightmare.  We had to keep ringing to receive our documentation when we had not received it 2 week's before we travelled. We never received anything in the post as promised and the website was always down when we tried to access our documentation that way.  They would not escalate our concerns so I even took to trying to contact someone on their staff on Linkedin.  I sent a number of emails and had no response from anybody.  Eventually the week before we travelled we received our documentation through email after I rang for the umpteenth time.  By this stage we still hadn't booked our flights from Sydney to Melbourne because we did not know what time we were embarking the ship but we sucked it up and hoped the actual cruise would be much better. When we arrived to embark they would not let our taxi go to the terminal.  We had to walk about a kilometre.  My husband has a brace on his leg and uses a walking stick.  We had to also walk our luggage with us.  My husband was exhausted by the time we actually got on the ship.  We decided to have lunch at the Queens Grill before going back to our cabin to relax.  The food was not good and they stumbled over what gluten free entailed.  After lunch we decided that we would get room service from then on.  In fairness, I do not have a sophisticated palette and I thought room service would suit me better.  The food in the Queens Grill was very rich.  After lunch my husband was in pain and needed to lie down.  I went off exploring after we had been told our departure would be delayed.  Mid-ship was lovely.  Nice shops that would not be opening until we were at sea and there was a nice coffee shop and the library was lovely.  If you needed any questions answered you had to ask other passengers as the crew were not forthcoming.  It was better anyhow because the passengers had more time to tell you their experience.  I went back to our cabin and we decided to order room service.  My husband did not want to walk all the way to the Queens Grill which was a pretty long walk from where we were.  The food was what you would expect from room service but it was not gluten-free as requested.  The fruit salad was very good however so I ate that.  Because  the Lido deck was pretty much above us, we went there for breakfast the next morning.  They didn't have a lot of gluten-free options but you at least you knew you were eating gluten-free food.  The buffet was actually quite nice.Because of the long walk to anywhere my husband spent most of the time in our cabin.  I couldn't do it as it was rocking and rolling and vibrating so I was either in the library or out walking the deck.  Mid-ship was definitely quieter and more stable than where we were.  A number of passengers tried to include me because they thought I was there on my own.  They all told me how crazy we were to get a cabin at the stern.  Sunday night we got room service and both my husband and I were getting a BLT - mine gluten-free.  Only one arrived and my husband ate it because we assumed it was his as it had chips and we had already been told they did not do gluten-free chips.  When we told our designated butler he said that they had sent the gluten free BLT.  I told them it had chips so we assumed it was my husband's meal and he said it was the gluten-free meal and to just leave the chips.  None of it was gluten-free, Another shambles.  Finally at 11.00pm on Sunday night the vibration decreased and we able to get some sleep.  It was still very unstable moving around.  By this stage, my husband had been in our cabin the entire trip.  It didn't matter who we spoke to nobody seemed to care.  At the end of the day, we were too far away from the action and restaurants.  The Queens Grilll and Lounge was too hard to get to and the suite we were in should definitely not have been a Q1.  All in all it was a pretty unpleasant experience and we would absolutely never go on a cruise again.   We were very thankful it was only such a short trip.  I know people are going to have had a fabulous time on the same trip because I believe if we had been in a cabin midship and closer to everything we too would have enjoyed it a lot more.  Considering the cost, our expectations were not met.  If we had not paid excessively for the experience we did not receive, it would not have left such a bad taste.Our advice is that you don't need to do the Queens Grill,  It over promises and hugely under delivers.   You get so much better value for money not flashing the cash.  You will just resent the cost when your expectations are not met.   I much preferred sharing the trip with the majority rather than the minority in the Grills.  The Grills are a total waste of money.We will be keeping our feet well and truly planted on solid ground from now on we  don't want to diminish the fabulous time other people will have had. I just do not want other people to spend excessively like us and have such a bad experience.",Sail Date: February 2020|Cabin Type: Suite|Type of Trip: |Destination: Australia|,"Sydney, Australia"

Then we noticed that service standards had declined in most areas, except for our cabin steward who was wonderful. The maitre d in the Britannia was incredibly rude when we asked to be seated together, and asked for the email address of the agent who had said we would be. Ridiculous! Apart from that, the restaurant service was very good (if not exceptional). Compared to previous Cunard cruises we found many services to be either downgraded, or more expensive, or both. For example, laundry now takes TWO days to return (unless you request express service) and liquor ordered in the shop must be collected, instead of being delivered to your room. We were horrified that people were allowed into the Britannia restaurant in t-shirts and track pants on FORMAL nights, when this attire is stated to be unacceptable even on 'smart attire' nights. Why anyone who does NOT like dressing for dinner would bother to travel on Cunard escapes me completely! Although very expensive drinks packages have now been introduced (A$100 per day) we found that bar staff were not interested in serving us once they realised we were on these packages. At home, I could buy two bottles of Scotch for the same price! Accordingly we drank many glasses of wine, cocktails, and Scotch to make the most of the package - I suspect we did not come out ahead.NB: avoid the Midships Bar, as it is the most expensive venue for drinks on the ship, for no apparent reason. We went to the Carinthia Cafe instead, for 'normal' prices. Only problem is that it is now more of a bar and less of a cafe; most of the time we couldn't order anything beyond nuts and crisps; seriously? Previously, on the QV, we could order all sorts of exotic snacks, although (decent) coffee was extra, even then.Frankly, we are now looking at all-inclusive packages (eg Seabourn or Crystal) in future, as they are ultimately MUCH less expensive overall, since they don't ""nickel and dime"" you for everything. Alternatively, Holland-America (still with Carnival though) where the cruise is half the price and the drinks are too.",Sail Date: January 2020|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: |Destination: South Pacific|,"Canberra, Australia"

I am not sure when it sank in that this was going to be a disastrous, but hugely expensive, voyage. I am wheelchair bound, and yet our cabin was the furthest that you could get to from the lifts - also not once when getting off this boat, did any other passenger or member of the crew help us. We were told to wait. Cunard charged us £160 to go up Table Mountain in Cape Town. If we had done the outing on the Hop-on Hop-off, it would have cost £40 for us together. Our cabin was dreadful. The bathroom was full of cracked and chipped tiles and the television was minuscule compared to fully abled cabins. Our balcony divider didn’t work, so kept banging the whole time. Noise came continuously through the cabin walls. We had breakfast in our cabin every day, and each day one or two items would be missing. Complaining became pointless. Altogether the staff were rude. I overheard a passenger asking the Loudmouth who appeared to be in charge of ‘the garden lounge bar’ for a milkshake to be told to go and find the ingredients and bring them back to him, so he could then make up. There seemed to be a Cunard mess-up every day, with them never taking the blame - we were late leaving Cape Town ‘because they had run out of fuel’, etc etc. The captain would use the word ‘excellent’ two or three times in every sentence she uttered. God, we were pleased to finally get off that boat. And I wish Cunard would stop harassing me to give them a review.",Sail Date: November 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Australia|,"London, United Kingdom"

It was my first time of the Queen Elizabeth, which I found quite similar to the Queen Victoria. In general, it was a relaxing and enjoyable cruise, although I didn't participate in many activities as my main aim was to rest after a challenging year. For this, it was wonderful. I enjoyed being on my own, able to mingle or retreat as I wished. I had booked a single cabin, and well in advance as the ship only has 5 of them. Embarkation was rather slow and frustrating, but once aboard, service was excellent, and my cabin spacious and comfortable. I loved watching the sea from my level 2 window - and especially enjoyed the antics of a school of dolphins just off the southern coast of Tasmania. I found the meals good in the Britannica restaurant, and light snacks were handy in the Lido. Most passengers seemed positive and well-behaved, but some were annoying and I suppose that is unavoidable wherever one goes.On our last evening, the crew sang Christmas carols on the grand stairway and it was quite special. During 'White Christmas' snow fell down gently upon them and it was a real treat. Mince tarts were handed around and the Christmas spirit was lovely.I found that Christmas and New Year was much more manageable after a pre-Christmas cruise, though it was hard to leave the clean sea air and go back to bushfire smoke again!",Sail Date: December 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: |Destination: Australia|,

The prices are nothing short of extortion.  The cheapest  house wine is $us 12 and there is a non negotiable service charge of 15%,  so 13.80 US for a miserable drink .  Vintage wines started at double this.The food was very ordinary , the breakfast buffet is standard hotel fare, the Britannia restaurant  has good service but the food is similar to Princess or P&O.  Some dishes were  actually unpleasant and difficult to eat:  dry chicken breast,  reheated dried out dumplings  and tired reheated vegetables. There are many restaurants that are either reserved for the higher classes or available at a very steep ( they call it nominal) cover charge.  We did not  try them as I have a deep suspicion that all the food comes from the same kitchen.On the good side: the ship is attractive, there is a good promenade deck, staff are polite and helpful and night entertainment is above average.

Cunard promises a wonderful experience with a butler who sees to your every whim.... we never saw ours once. I don’t believe they exist. I need extra pillows to sleep more upright and I asked three times for these but they never came..... like the elusive butler!Our cabin also wasn’t made up in the morning and when returning at lunch time I had to call and get someone to come to do it. Also although I complained on board 3 times about the shoddy service no one did anything about it. Cunard shouldn’t advertise a service they don’t actually provide. It must be false advertisement. To add insult to injury the stewards decided to move our personal belongings off our bed and strip and remake it for the next guest even though we hadn’t even vacated the cabin. We hadn’t even finished packing and had gone for breakfast. Cunard think this is acceptable and even though I complained about the non existent butler, the fact no one acted on my complaints even though I met the concierge face to face and spoke to them on the phone, no chance of an extra pillow and being thrown out of our room by the stewards before we even finished packing. It cost over £900 for two days and it was definitely not worth it. When I complained when I got home Cunard said sorry that was it.

The Brittania restaurant food was inconsistent, I don't think I ever competed a full meal or really enjoyed their food. The Lido buffet was ghastly, very little choice and some of it didn't look very fresh. The dessert selection was woeful, I think a new pastry chef might help. The bar staff across the ship were often rude and muddled up orders. The drink prices were very expensive. Whoever made my Singapore Sling needed a trip to Singapore. The entertainment and guest speakers were great. However if you didn't like ballroom dancing there was very little night time entertainment.

The food was also good as was room service.  Fantastic professional dancers on board who also gave a short dancing lesson during the day.  I mainly went on this cruise to practice some of my ballroom dancing, for which I had been taking lessons.  I had heard that Cunard provide gentleman dance hosts to dance with the single ladies.  I was very disappointed with their standard of 'dancing'!  One elderly gentleman host, although very pleasant in personality,  had lost his balance, one was a woman who was like dancing with a wet lettuce, and another had halitosis!  Only one of the four could dance.  Such a pity.  I contacted Cunard on my return and they gave me £100 rebate which wasn't very much for a spoilt holiday.  They suggested that there were other lovely things to enjoy - apart from the dancing - such as nice ports of call, but when I chose this holiday for the ballroom dancing, naturally I felt very let down.  I suggested that they put their dance hosts through more stringent auditions.  From my experience, I would doubt that any auditions were done at all.   I knew that Cunard doesn't do the open dining and thought that it would be alright for me, but I found that dining with the same people each night quite tiresome, especially as one or two people on the table were not easy to be with.  A lovely ship, though, with a beautiful ballroom.

The ship was fine and while the interior decor was fairly new, it had a very 'dated look' about it.The food was good but only par for the course with most modern cruise liners and nothing to write home about.  The Xmas dinner was 'just another meal' and all menu's were written using American terms - entree for 'main course'.  Sure, you soon catch on, but for a supposedly 'English' ship in Pacific waters ?Now the gripes: The alternative dining room - Verandah - charged a USD$39 per person premium. While a premium was expected, $39 (A$56) was a tad over the top. To add further insult, there were further charges of USD$19 (A$27) for a Wagyu steak !Drink (wine) costs appeared numerically 'acceptable' until converted to AUD$ and the (mandatory) 15% service charge included. Thus a small (125mL) glass of very ordinary plonk at USD$12 cost A$19.30. Two pre-dinner drinks for a couple soon adds up.  Beer and spirits were similarly priced.Ship photos - USD$30 each ?Zero toothpicks available on board the vessel (maybe an OH&S risk ?).Unfortunately, the general impression given was that nothing was provided free of charge that couldn't be charged for - and then at a premium price.Satellite TV at sea was poor with intermittent reception.  (Perhaps the satellite dish controller was broken and/or couldn't track the satellite on basically calm seas.  Or maybe would cost too much to fix ?)Good points:Nearly all service and room staff were friendly, efficient and appeared happy doing their work.

I had previously photographed the lights in Finland and found the cost of this cruise made it better value with more opportunities to photograph the lights.The first problem was that as soon as the tours opened to be booked the ones involving the lights were already sold out.  I was wait listed and booked tours with external companies so as not to miss out.  I later received emails from Cunard advising me that i had no chance of getting on their tours, which was fine with me as I had arranged alternatives. The first night on the ship and tickets arrive for their tours, which a visit to their tour staff found a new home with somebody else, but was frustrating given their emails.My biggest gripe was with a many of the passengers who according to my mother were not the usual crowd she would see on these ships.It was great to see the number of passengers who had mobility issues being looked after and having a ball on the ship.  It was the behaviour of other passengers which I couldnt agree with.  It was apparent on so many occassions that a limited mobility passenger  (LMP) had been waiting for a lift, and when a lift came other passengers who arrived later would push into the lift ahead of the LMP and then there would not be enough room for that passenger.  On two occassions I saw this from inside a lift and would walk out of the lift to make sure that the LMP could get in and comment so that other passengers might learn some consideration for others.  My first dining experience was the Lido Buffet and there was a great selection and the food was alright but wouldnt rush to it.  Again the attitude of the passengers who appeared to have not eaten in months were swarming like locusts around loading their plates up and then often not eating much of what they took.  Why not take some, eat it and if you want more go back.  Dining in the Britannia Dining Room was great and most breakfasts and dinners were had here.  We chose to share a table for dinner and the three other couples were wonderful people, from different walks of life and experiences and were a delight.  As I said to them on the last night as I proposed a toast to them, they were the one thing I had to look forward to each day on the ship was their company.One of the tests for a kitchen is how well they cook a consomme and on this ship the quality of the food which came out was generally exceptional, particularly the consommes.  We had one lady with a food allergy, so our head waiter would bring her the next night's menu as she had to preorder so that they could prepare food without nuts etc.  This gave us an advantage of knowing what was on the menu.  If the evening menu didnt interest her, she could order something from the lunch menu.  This proved to be wonderful as one day at lunch they did a french onion soup so four of us asked if we could also order that and it was wonderful.The waiters we had were sensational and the dining experience was very enjoyable and there was only one night that i can remember not being that thrilled with the options, but that is a first world problem.We would have breakfasts most mornings there, and where most people wanted tables of two, we would always simply tell the MD to put us wherever he wanted us so share tables it was.  We met some great people at breakfast and ordered what we wanted and no request was too difficult.  On a number of mornings we may be with the same people as we'd arrive at similar times so we could continue with conversations etc and was certainly the way to meet other cruisers.One morning at breakfast I met one lady and we spoke about photography given that that was the focus of the cruise.  I gave her some advice and we spoke of a lecture given later that day.  Ultimately we met up at that lecture and also she ended up on the same tours as me as I gave her the details of what I was doing.  A friendship and memorable photos have resulted from that.I had booked a balcony room as I wanted the option to shoot photos from outside if the circumstances were right.  I also enjoyed having my own space where I could sit and think.  I feel that it was worth paying the extra for, although when my mother travels alone she takes an inboard room as she is never in it other than to change or sleep.Our cabin steward was exceptional.  After I left my room for the first time, he was in the corridor and he mentioned me by name.  I had seen his name on a card in my room and I asked him if that was him and his eyes lit up and smiled and said yes.  He became the best person on the ship to me and nothing was too much trouble for him to make us comfortable.  Other passengers seemed to treat the staff as invisible people or would be rude to them which i found offensive, but I was unfortunately getting used to it.I used to love to go to the Commodores Room for drinks after dinner. We had chosen the early sitting as it allowed us to do more at night if we wanted to.  We would arrive as the late sitting people were leaving and it was a wonderful place to relax and have a drink together.  Again treat the staff well and they look after you so well and that is without having to tip etc.  Again I saw so many passengers who thought that they were entitled to things or could treat staff poorly.  It was clear from watching the floor, who were decent people and those who were rude.Often lunches were had in the lion bar where the fish and chips were obviously very popular as were the ploughman's lunches.  They couldnt be faulted and well worth getting a table there and relaxing.They offered photography workshops to anybody who wanted to improve their lights shots.  As they offered an advanced course, I and another passenger paid to do that.  When we met our lecturer the first thing that she told us was that she didnt think that she could teach us anything (not a promising start) which turned out to be true so that was a waste of money.  Although the time spent with the other passenger comparing notes and photos was a pleasure.We would often do afternoon teas and again would share with others.  Some of the people we met were a delight and many memorable afternoons were had.  It is highly recommended and you can eat a little or a lot depending on your mood.  Often I just had tea.There was so much to do or as little as you wanted to.  Quizs, dancing, shows, lectures, tours etc there was so much on offer.  Most of it wasn't for me but would do the occasional  quiz session.The real question I have been mulling over is, would I do it again?The honest answer is that I dont know.  In terms of price it was a good value trip given what was included and you certainly wouldnt starve as the options of all day and night dining was broad for choice.  The staff were exceptional and a credit to Cunard.  My dinner guests were perfect and couldnt have asked for better.  My real problem was the attitude of so many guests who only thought about themselves and nobody else, but that is life I suppose.  I had hoped that they might have been a little more refined and it may have been the nature of this particular cruise.  If the right cruise came up again I might go, but i'm used to being flexible with my travel and you cant be on a ship as you have curfews due to sailing to the next port.It may be that I went with unrealistic expectations and rose coloured glasses that you wouldnt get the usual; cross section of society.  There were a number of people who I enjoyed their company and as I reflect on this trip i see their faces as well as the wonderful staff I had regular contact with and not the others, so that is a positive.It is a cruise line I would recommend given my mother's experience of spending a year on cunard ships in total to date and her descriptions of her travels.  I might have to go on one more to see if my opinion remains the same or changes.  I might find a cruise on the Queen Mary to see if the larger ship with the same number of passengers makes it more bearable for me.",Sail Date: October 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Europe|,Tasmania

Cunard obviously take cruising very seriously indeed. We could not fault them. Their staff are wonderful & we were spoilt throughout the holiday. Food is exceptional as is everything. The ship gleams and is huge. You can do as much or as little as you like. Plenty of games to play on deck including shuffleboard, paddle & table tennis, quoits, bowls, croquet etc! There is a library, card room, ballroom, pub type place, just everything including many bars and sitting areas. Following every evening meal there is a concert in the theatre with resident band (who are brilliant) & a selection of very good acts. There are also musicians scattered around the boat including harpist, pianists, string trio, who are all amazing.

We drove to Southampton for our two week trip last Oct 2018.  Luggage removed from the boot, we were directed to a meet and greet desk where a receptionist checked our e ticket, gave me a card with a letter on and told to board when this letter was called! very quick!We then went through security and boarded the ship, my first cruise and a fantastic experience. It felt like stepping back in time as we embarked. The deco is just perfect and made me immediately feel like I’d stepped onto the Titanic   WiFi usage is prohibitively expensive and Marketing is everywhere - the photo ""service"" is a prime example: ""Have your picture taken with the captain"" and then find out there is a $40.00 charge. Guests are constantly bombarded with information on future cruises to the point of absurdity, so be ware. Electrical service in our room was lost twice. We stayed in a Princess suite which was perfect. complementary Champagne  in our cabin was very nice roomy close to lifts.   Enough room so we weren’t bumping into each other over an 18 day cruise. And it’s lovely to have separate sinks and a bathtub for the days you want to soak. The dining room for the princess grilles is truly fine dining, it’s not a large room and mostly there are tables for two. You feel like you’re in a five-star restaurant.  the restaurant offered top quality beef . The seafood, the veal, the lamb, the chicken and the pork, they’re all wonderful. Afternoon Tea is very British, and very good - an experience akin to London's fine hotels..The staff are nothing short of amazing. Shout outs to our room Butlers  our head waiter, our assistant waiter and our sommelier. These men are so professional, skillful and enjoyable. They make life on the ship very good. All of the front line staff are just remarkable.They added an extra $30 a day to our bill to cover tips for their staff, you can ask the purser to remove this and just pay the staff yourselfThe theatre is absolutely beautiful along with most areas around the ship.

Now retired with more time, we have been on Q. Elizabeth two years ago to Norway, Q.Victoria last year round UK, Q.Mary short break last Autumn and Q.Elizabeth again in October for Baltic cruise. So believe me, we can comment that standards are lower.We always do Queens Grill. We figure so many extras are included that its as good a deal as Britannia plus a big bar bill, which we don’t have!The suite was fantastic as usual, as was our butler. He was the best thing about this last cruise. Nothing was too much trouble for him. We didn’t think it was necessary to replace lights with LED lights during a voyage. Especially as debris was left everywhere, glass and broken bloody fingernail on our towel.The menu was simply not as good as on previous cruises. The choices were poor. They no longer have a curry in every lunchtime. Usually the Gala evenings have an extra special menu but you couldn’t differentiate this time. We were struggling to find something different to choose. As we were Queens Grill, you do also have the A la Carte menu too, but there is a limit to how many times you want to eat from that, and you have to pre order at lunchtime, which is not always possible if you are on a  tour. The food was very overcooked. Our neighbours were fish eaters and they kept sending it back. One passenger sent something back at 8.15 and was told that there were no staff on duty in the kitchen to cook it! It tasted as though it had been cooked ages before, and kept warm. This even applied to the a la carte choices. This especially applied if you put in a special request. The other thing I noticed was that previously a lot of dishes were cooked for you at the table, but now they don’t. Their “extensive” cheese board had only five cheeses on it! Come on Cunard, do you think passengers don’t notice? The service was brilliant as usual, which is why we tipped on top of the service charge. It isn’t the fault of the staff, they can only serve what they are given to serve.We actually got to the point that we dined in our cabin as it wasn’t worth getting dressed up to go in to dinner. So we slobber around and chilled out in front if the tv,which we could have done at home for free! The entertainment was non existent. There were four quizzes each day, so you entertain yourself. Or choir practice where you, entertain yourself. Or bridge where you, entertain yourself! Get the message? Where were the computer classes, photography classes and interesting lectures? Our cruise there were a series of lectures on Concorde. So if you weren’t interested in Concorde there were no other lectures! The films they put on were an odd choice to such an extent that we didn’t watch one, which is unusual! The one film we would have liked was put on at 10pm the day before we disembarked.The shows quite simply held no appeal and as such we also didn’t see one. Usually you here a comment about missing a good show, but not this time! The comments were the opposite. There were no big names at all. One act was put on twice, a tribute act. That’s fine but in the past it wasn’t tribute acts but the real thing! We could list big celebrities we have seen in the past . As we were in a suite we have paid an eye watering amount for this cruise, and this is the first cruise ever where we felt it was a total amount of money.If these sound like complaints, we would say they are comments. I took the trouble while on board to write a three page letter and asked for a written reply. None has been forthcoming. I have chased it up, and was told that two people spoke to me on the ship, which was incorrect. I have written back...Please don’t underestimate the passengers comments Cunard. We are highly unlikely to sail with Cunard in immediate future. For all the reasons above.

To stick, Helsinki, Riga,Tallinn and Copenhagen were all very interesting to visit. Tours were well organised. Embarkation and disembarkation was so smooth & quick. We were off the boat and into our car within 15 minutes.However, Cunard spoilt it all because they are money grubbing! They charge extortionate prices for drinks, spa treatments and goods and then put on a 15% service charge (12.5% for spa). They charge for bottled water, exercise classes and internet access (very slow and it wastes most of your minutes connecting). I spoke to several guests who said the same.

The journey across the Indian Ocean was very windy and not particularly warm so there was no sitting out on the deck making for a long time at sea. Entertainment was geared to an older demographic.

Half of these were staff. Two evenings there was a fabulous band in the ballroom and it was packed with hundreds of people. So while I can see that Cunard are trying to hold on tight to their traditions, it's not working. Everyone was in bed by 9.30pm until the Australians embarked in Perth then the place livened up !.Food is excellent as is the high tea every afternoon.

A horrible experience,"The Cunard Line's ships used to be known for their elegance and excellence in service. No longer! Carnival has bought the line and its ships, and the Carnival influence is unmistakable. Yes, the Queen Elizabeth is a beautiful ship - its public areas are quite impressive and lovely. The entertainment offered is at least as good, if not better, in some cases, than other ships. Meals in the Brittannia Restaurant are very good (excellent in some cases), and the service is impeccable. Afternoon Tea is very British, and very good - an experience akin to London's fine hotels. The schedule of programs is very good, and lectures are taped and later shown on your room's TV. Meeting other guests is usually a delight, and the ship even has ""mixers"" for singles and members of the GBLT community.HOWEVER, my complaints vastly outnumber the positives. Above all, whenever dealing with the Purser's Office, I felt demeaned, degraded, and insulted. An example: There is a ""Black Book"" in every room detailing the ship's services, etc. Whenever I would call to ask a simple question, the first words I always heard the ""customer service"" representative say were ""If you had taken the time to read your ""Black Book"", you would have found that the answer is..."" How absolutely condescending!Another example: Only ""smart attire"" is allowed in public areas (except the casual Lido deck buffets - more on those later) is allowed after 6:00 pm. Even if you have been in one of the lounges for over a hour, and order a cocktail at 5:45, promptly at 6:00 you are STERNLY reminded that you do not have a jacket on, and are inappropriately enjoying your cocktail. I rebelled - I politely informed the crew member that I was going to finish my drink first before I vacated the area, and then took my time. I was met with icy stares as I left.Room service is spotty at best. WiFi usage is prohibitively expensive. Marketing is everywhere - the photo ""service"" is a prime example: ""Have your picture taken with the captain"" and then find out there is a $40.00 charge. Guests are constantly bombarded with information on future cruises to the point of absurdity. Electrical service in our room was lost twice. Passengers almost must fight with each other for access to the limited laundry facilities.There is no standard electrical plug in the bathroom.On an 18 day cruise, the men's sauna was ""closed for repairs"" the entire last week.There is no rhyme or reason to the placement of food items in the Lido buffet. You must visit THREE SEPARATE STATIONS to make a salad! Iced tea is only offered at one of four drink stations, and there is always a line to get to it. Drink stations are horribly organized - I heard on at least five occasions, ""They need to get an efficiency expert to fix this.""But worst of all, I was injured due to the ship's negligence on the first day of the cruise (too long a story to relay) and was charged for medical attention for my injury! I followed all of the proper procedures and inquired several times as to reimbursement, but have had no response to this day.I could go on and on, but these items reflect the nature of my experience.",Sail Date: July 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Europe|,"Richmond, Virginia"

Enough room so we weren’t bumping into each  other over an 18 day cruise.  And it’s lovely to have separate sinks and a bathtub for the days you want to soak.    The dining room for the princess grilles is truly fine dining, it’s not a large room and mostly there are tables for two. You feel like you’re in a five-star restaurant. Our only issue with the restaurant is that the beef is not top quality and we stopped ordering any beef after the third day.  The seafood, the veal, the lamb, the chicken and the pork, they’re all wonderful.This particular itinerary interested us because it left from Fort Lauderdale, went up to Canada, across to Iceland and ended up in the UK. It was not your run-of-the-mill cruise itinerary, so we saw some different countries.

We love these ships.   They are extremely comfortable and clean.  The staff are nothing short of amazing.   Shout outs to our room steward John, our head waiter Edward, our assistant waiter Mel and our sommelier Will.   These men are so professional, skillful and enjoyable.  They make life on the ship very good.  All of the front line staff are just remarkable.We don't look for a lot of activities on a cruise ship.  The excursions, the breathtaking scenery from our balcony and the lectures we went to gave us plenty to do.  We spend a considerable amount of time walking around deck three to manage the overload of food.  The two lecturers we saw on this trip for 5 different lectures, were amazing.  Dr. Rachel Cartwright, a naturalist provided three exciting presentations on what we would see in Alaska, including in depth presentations on Humpback Whales and glaciers.  She gave commentary as we cruised along that was really helpful.   Dr. Charles Barclay is an astronomer from the U.K. who provided two fascinating lectures.  One on getting started looking at the stars and planets, for which he really needs to write a book, and one on eclipses.   Dining of course is very important on a ship.  We really like to take advantage of the social opportunities by always dining in our main dining room, with larger groups.  We are assigned to 4 other people for dinner, but usually sit with a mix of people for breakfast and lunch.   We met so many really nice and fun people, from many countries.  We exchanged contact information with one Australian couple, and we have stayed in touch with many travelers over the years.  Cunard does a great job of matching people up for dinner.  I really admire how well they accomplish that.The food is always prepared perfectly.  We have been somewhat grumpy that we didn't get Alaskan King Crab as a dinner choice, while in Alaska.  I did just read in a review in Cruise Critic of this same voyage, that an unannounced King Crab Buffet was offered at lunch one day.  We somehow missed that one.  We did feel that some of the food was a bit blander than in past years.   But there are lots of choices and overall food is wonderful.Excursions were all good.  But the Captain really excelled in her handling of the ship at Hubbard Glacier.  She got the ship up very close and turned 360 degrees several times over a 2 hour period so everyone on the ship could get a good look.  A small group of people got off the ship in front of the glacier onto a smaller ship for an even closer look.  That must have been really exciting.Yes, dress for dinner is more formal than almost any American likes.  However, we do like the dress up dinners.  It is nice to get dressed up for dinner and not sit next to a table of people in shorts and flip flops.  The buffets do not require special clothing and the food there is excellent, if you really don't want to dress up.  This is not much of a ship for children.  There are activities for children, but they are definitely secondary to adult considerations.  For adults looking for peace and quiet, time to think, something new to learn, someone interesting to talk to, this is a wonderful wonderful cruise.",Sail Date: June 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Alaska|,"Phoenix, Arizona"

We will NEVER cruise with them again! This ship is geared for those who are old in both age and spirit. The daily routine had little to no variation. Trivia four times daily, anyone? Many activities are decidedly British: darts, quoits, bowls. There is a two-story library where you can check out books and a large room for playing bridge/cards. The main dance floor was given over to ballroom dancing every night. The nightclub was like a ghost town. Evening shows had a talented cast who sang and dance to the hits of yesteryear (as in 40+ years old). There is also the usual casino, art gallery, deck full of shops and high-pressure photography sales push. The pool is uncovered and went unused through most of the chilly trip. You have to pay a daily spa fee if you want to use the covered jacuzzi. They have a separate dining room for those booking the high-end suites. Tut! Tut! Musn't mingle with the riff-raff! This effectually negates being able to dine with someone you meet on the ship if they reside on the upper decks unless you consign yourself to the dreadful Lido buffet or pay a surcharge to dine in the sole other restaurant available. The ship does have an extensive selection of British ales and a good gin martini bar (for which you must don a jacket in order to be served).

The main dining room is open for lunch and dinner though. We had booked a precruise excursion, but got no instructions on how to get our tickets. We managed to hang out at the disembarkation ramp, and snagged the manager, who issued us tickets after she confirmed our booking. Disembarking passengers were also on the tour, and we were all dropped off back at the ramp, except those going to airport.If you like ballroom dancing and a decidedly British flavour, then this is your cruise. If you want a more casual atmosphere, then go elsewhere. There weren't many sea days, so I missed most of the lectures live. They were on tv later. Excursions were organized as per usual, except the first day, which was a madhouse. Also disembarkation was decidedly confusing. But as this was her maiden Alaska cruise, hopefully they will sort this out. Internet is not free, and you buy block minutes.

Because the weather didn’t cooperate I found there was not enough to do on sea days. Captain Alex was great entertainment in the evenings was very good. We found the food quality less than we remembered and the variety not as interesting. We tried one of the speciality restaurants but found we overate so decided to stick with regular dining room. Our service was excellent. We booked three shore excursions through the ship and on one of them the Trans Alpine Train we were very dissatisfied. We spent six hours on a bus and a little less than two on the train. We got a butter sandwich for lunch. The excursion was way overpriced for its value and when we mentioned what we paid to other passengers we discovered we had paid almost double what they had. When we complained on the ship after going very high up we received a 30% rebate which is still not in line with what others had paid. This excursion is way over priced and is not as described. I suggest avoiding it in Akorua. In Dunedin we enjoyed the Taori gorge train and in Taraunga the visit to the hobbit on movie set was fun. Our guide Sonny was great.

Solstice is a very elegant ship with a lot of old world charm. The passengers are mostly over 45 with no children. The ship had a quiet games room and library, with many fancy bars. In saying that our children 6 and 9 had a fantasist time. Our children still loved the small pools and kids club. The 6 year old made many friends in the 6-9 year old kids club room and loved the activities. Our 9 year old had an age review and was allowed in the 9-12 year room, much suited to him. He was allowed to sign himself in and out and could access the basketball court, games room and buffet (for gelato) with his friends whenever he wanted. The kids club was free 9-12, 2-5 and 7-9pm, the time in between you could pay $6US an hour to stay for lunch. We paid for the kids dinner one night so we could go to a speciality restaurant. With the kids we made sure we did the family activities provided on board together then they could go to kids club when we did our thing. Meals were free I. The buffet or a menu meal in the dining, we mostly did buffet for breakfast, lunch near the pool (free) and dinner in the dining room. We did try two specialty restaurants (paid) the Tuscan restaurant, it was beautiful, located at the back of the ship with large windows, food was great.we also went to the Petite Chef, which a projected show on our dinner table, it highly recommended, my kids and parents loved it.Alcohol was expensive, about $9US for a beer. we purchased one drinks package for my husband and I paid for mine. It was worth buying the one package but we certainly wouldn’t have used two. We also purchased two internet packages and we are glad we did. You can get lost on the boat.We loved the islands, we didn’t book anything through the ship. Noumea we got a hop on, hop off bus. Lemon Bay beach and restaurants were worth the stop. On mystery island we booked a package (on the island) it had three tours included, this was too many. We did a villa/school tour which was great and a snorkeling tour. We loved both of these but run out of time to just enjoy the island. Port villa was my favourite, there were lots of drivers waiting outside the cruise ship, very overwhelming, you need to negotiate your price, i with I did some research before we went. We paid $150 to get driven to the Blue Lagoon, highly recommended and a waterfall, which was also good. Unfortunately we still had to pay to get into the waterfalls, roughly $50 a family. Again we didn’t get to spend time in the Main Street, apparently the shopping is good. There wasn’t much to to do on the last islands Lifou and Mare. Mare you catch a bus to the beach, it was a beautiful snorkel beach, I sat and drank beer. Lifou we caught a bus to the other side but I wished we had just stayed and walked to the close tourist attractions. My dad is in a wheelchair and he was able to access everything on the boat and he could get off at two islands.Overall we had a memorable time and would now do another cruise.",Sail Date: January 2020|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: South Pacific|,

We booked everything at exactly the same time.     I called Celebrity about this and they would not do anything to help us.   No future credit, no refund, nothing.    They said it was all our fault.

They had our money, tough luck.   I even pointed out that we had four cruises booked in two years with them.

Everything in the cabin was pristinely clean and well maintained.The suite was excellent, spacious, well maintained and better than the suites we stayed in on 2 other cruise lines last year. Food:We could not fault any of the food, we ate in the buffet and found there to be an excellent selection of various cuisines. We went there a few times as there was a great variety, and we enjoyed everything we ate. Breakfast can be very busy, also lunch, choose your times and there won't be an issue. Again, compared to the other 2 cruise lines we travelled with last year there was no comparison, the other cruise line buffets we ate at were dreadful and we simply couldn't eat there. Interesting to read other reviews where people complain of the food on the Solstice, not sure if they were even on the same ship.Sushi on five was great, we tried a lot of things on the menu and really enjoyed everything we ate. The ramen noodles were the only thing that we found not to be outstanding, however the broth was delicious.Murano is our favourite, and we went there twice, the food is excellent, the ambience and the wait staff there are also excellent.Petit Chef is a new concept which you really have to experience to understand it. It is a set menu with the whole table being animated, and an interactive dinner experience. We all loved it and were pleased we went. Food was also excellent.Crew:Everyone on board was fantastic, nothing was a problem and everyone we encountered was professional, friendly and efficient.Shore excursions:We did our own thing; however, the tendering was extremely efficient and again we were very impressed.The ship:Beautifully maintained, everything is kept looking good, we were surprised as other reviews differed in this respect. Not sure what people are expecting, but we found it excellent. Our friends had not been on a cruise before and loved everything about the ship, service, food etc. We were discussing on our last night what faults we could find, and there were none.There are loads of places to hang out, we spent a lot of our time on the lawn club. Yes, this is real grass on the top deck, lovely to sit on, watch movies, have a drink and just relax.The shows we went to were great, the comedian, the illusionist and the show on the last night was fantastic.This is a well-oiled machine, and anyone with complaints I would seriously wonder what the issue is. We did meet one guy on the cruise who didn't enjoy it, because another passenger didn't greet him in the lift. Wondering if people bring their own issues with them and take it out on the cruise line. Comparing the experience we had with some of the reviews, doesn't corelate at all. As previous, we travelled with 2 other cruise lines last year, been on 3 Celebrity cruises, and would not cruise again with anyone else, as nothing is comparable.

Most recently three back to backs -- started in Seattle, went through Alaska to Vancouver, Vancouver to Hawaii and Hawaii to Sydney -- 35 days in total. Along the way we experienced Concierge class (balcony), inside cabin and suite. It was a great trip. Fantastic, lively, funny and engaging Captain Theo, great staff and crew, good food and fantastic shore visits. That's not to say thingd didn't go awry at times, but the responses of the crew and the company meant these became ""yee-ha"" moments, rather than pain points. For example, there was an issue with a train journey on one trip -- nothing to do with the ship. We missed out on a return trip through the same countryside as the one we'd already taken. That meant we got to see more than we'd initially planned, and also had some time on a bus instead. The shore excursion did run an hour later than initial planned. We were delighted a couple of days later to realise we'd received more than half our money back.The trip to Alaska is lovely. We were blessed with beautiful days (we were there early September), very little rain and relative warmth. We loved the whale watching tour and the other shore excursions we did. We got to see bears, bald-headed eagles, seals, killer whales and humbacks along the way with spectacular sunsets, magnificent glaciers and more. It's definitely worth avoiding the very commercialised shops in the ports, but there it was a great experience. The Celebrity experience is probably for a somewhat older market -- not as old as Cunard or some of the others, but not as party-focussed as Norwegian or Carnival. Events, embarkation and departures tend to be well-organised.On this trip we were accompanied by my rather eccentric, picky, fussy and highly anxious mother. Again, the staff went out of their way to ensure she was comfortable and had everything she wanted and needed.We are very happy with Celebrity and will definitely sail again.   The suite experience was definitely largely and the level of attention and service even greater. Luminae Restaurant had fantastic food for lunch and dinner. On one leg, we had four in the cabin. It's worth noting that the 'sofa bed' is a couch and probably best suited for children or younger people.The Captain's Club host, concierge and Michael's Club host all went out of their way to ensure we had a great experience.",Sail Date: September 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Alaska|,"Perth, Australia"

I paid $7,000 (same as a guest in a suit) in an Ocean cabin on deck 3. Does this feel fair Celebrity?I feel disappointed and frustrated with this kind of treatment from Celebrity. We are individuals and NOT a number!!!The least you could do is give me a $500 voucher for my next cruise. I would love to cruise on the new Edge ship in the future. Please make my day!Daniela Celebrity ResponseMs. Ceccato, we realize we must earn your business by providing the best possible service both on and off the ships.

The officers and crew offer a first rate service and take obvious pride in what they do. The atmosphere on board was friendly and highly organised.

(and gluten free),"What fun! What a great crew! If you are lucky enough to go to Auckland and Australia this year or next enjoy the celebrity solstice. I have cruised on Oceana, Holland America, and Princess cruises, all on smaller ships and thought that this cruise might feel crowded and overwhelming. Instead I found it perfectly comfortable. The crew was excellent, always happy and welcoming. (Evidently on celebrity they have a nine hour shift, which allows them time to also enjoy themselves.)As a solo traveller for the first time, I was wary. however I needn’t have been. I thoroughly enjoyed the people I met on the ship from England, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, and the United States. By joining a “shared table” in the grand dining room you had the company of a different group of people each night. I also found that dining in the oasis cafe was terrific as I am gluten intolerant. They had notations, labels, for foods that were gluten-free or vegan or vegetarian. They had a separate area for gluten-free desserts, made gluten-free pizzas in a separate oven, toasted Canyon Ranch Breads in a separate toaster, and answered all my questions regarding the gluten-free entries. I was so impressed by their attention to detail. Ask for Chris, chef, he is delightful and will help you find whatever you need. I’m not big on the tours I prefer to see what I can see locally. In Wellington go to the botanical Gardens. Take the free shuttle into town, a short walk takes you to the cable car (Inexpensive) up the mountain to the top, then enjoy meandering through the park. In Dunedin I went horseback riding at Hare Hill Farm, Dunedin. You will need to contact them yourself online, it is not a ship sponsored tour. They pick you up just across from the pier to enjoy a gentle ride with lovely horses up to the top of the hill on the farm. They have English style saddles, so be prepared to hoist  yourself up their way!. I visited a college friend in Hobart. We went to Lake St Clare and the wall exhibit. It’s a 2 1/2 hour drive, but well worth the trip. “The wall” exhibit is extraordinary!, After we went to the lodge at St Clair lake and had an organic lunch, delicious. Next day off to the top of Mount Wellington  It was an extraordinarily windy day with exceptional views. We lunched at a sushi restaurant on the pier, delicious, and had ice cream short walk down towards the ship. There is a lovely grass area at the top of the ship, and at the very back a nice bar area that is not too frequented, at least not on this cruise. In this area there is also an outdoor theatre, and glassblowing which is fascinating to watch.  Look for Leo in the Cellar Masters and tell him Caren from California said hello. He is a joy to talk to and knows his wine. (I ignored all the hype for a drinks package as tea and coffee in the oasis cafe, and purchasing a glass of wine each night was just right for me.  I also purchased water off the ship and brought it on as needed)I can’t wait to go back,Needless to say I thoroughly enjoyed my trip!",Sail Date: November 2019|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: Solo|Destination: Australia|,"Fresno, California"

The only slight grumble was when using the buffet for either brakfast or lunch,it was incredibly busy and difficult to finda seat/table. When using the coffee shop the girls were fantastic,within two days they knew your name and your prefered drink. The waiters in the mdr were the same.

We happen to fit those qualifications, and this was our second Celebrity cruise. Two more are in planning. Bought along a book to read but never opened it. Met and dined with several other couples and had some pleasant evenings doing so. Liked the in-depth tour of the boat and also the excellent presentations on ports of call before reaching them by Mary Amanda Fairchild. She was a fine and practiced speaker and knowledgeable reviewer of both sights to see and the history of the locations we visited. Bought several of those talks on CD, but was sorely disappointed she had not recorded one on the presentation she did on Paul Gaugain before we reached Tahiti. We had a little bout of rough water in the Tasman Sea (my first such), but on such a big ship with stabilizers it was of little concern or discomfort, We met and talked with the man (reporting to the captain) who manages all but about 100 (those operating the boat) of the 1200-person crew.

We were all disappointed. It was my first cruise but my wife has been on many.First, we had to turn around and go back to Seattle the first day. At least offer us something.  Nope. Our room, in the Aqua class (which is supposed to be nicer), was shabby. Pictures were missing from the wall and we got towels with holes in them every single day. We were missing amenities that we never got. We told them we were celerbating our honeymoon. All they offered was a photo shoot which we had to pay for.We couldnt get sleep because invariably there was crew and maintenance noise from the deck above and they chose at sea days to do loud maintenance.Good luck finding even a seat for two at the buffet.  The food was marginal when we did eat there so no loss..They served some sort of weird hamburgers on the deck--they tasted like those fake burgers you got in grade school.Ashtrays overflowed in the smoking areas.Good luck finding a seat at the bars to have a drink. and then plan on waiting for service. The Captain seems totally obssesed with himself. Entertainment was limited to really lame stuff involving the crew. There was nothing to do during the day.The bright spot is with Aqua class we got our own restaurant and the food was pretty decent and the service amazing.  When we joined our friends in the main dining room twice for dinner service was slow and the food was not good.Just to get to the towns you had to take shuttles which you had to pay for. other ships had front row parking.

Our last trip on this ship was about 4 years ago and two things have improved in the meantime - the chairs and the food! On our previous cruise the food was very American in style with far too much in the way of added flavour, but this time it was much more natural in taste which was very pleasant. We had an Aqua suite and ate at Blu restaurant most nights which offered a nice range of menu items across the board in more intimate surroundings than the main restaurant, Grand Eperney.As for the seating on board, many of the chairs around the ship on our last cruise were rather low to sit on and quite a few didnt have arms. This made getting up from them rather difficult if you had mobility problems whereas this time most were now higher and had arms relieving that problem totally.As an Aqua cabin user, we also had access to the Persian Garden area and in reality, that was why we booked Aqua. We enjoyed the opportunity to start the day with a visit to the steam room followed by a Spring shower and a lay on the ceramic heated beds. Sadly, the steam room often had some problems when they turned it on each morning. This affected about half of the 17 days of the cruise, though for the final three days after they turned it off completely for some sort of overhaul, it worked flawlessly, suggesting the problem had been curable earlier, which was  a little frustrating. Nonetheless, the Persian Garden area is well worth the extra money - when it is working.The service throughout the ship was almost always beyond belief. For those who like staff who will do anything to make your stay on board as pleasant as possible, this is the ship for you. On some cruises in the past we have noticed an element of fear among the staff as if they were being watched and judged every minute of the day, but on the Solstice, the crew were relaxed and efficient and seemed to be enjoying the passengers as much as the passengers were enjoying them. And as for their ability to remember passengers names and preferences - I am at a loss to understand HOW they did that! They apparently recall EVERY little detail and every single name - and that is an amazing skill.So, pretty much across the board, the staff were excellent, with the notable exception of Future Cruise staff who appear to know VERY little about the product they are selling. We visited their office twice with the purpose of booking a future cruise and twice walked away without booking one. Adding to their lack of knowledge is the fact that on a previous cruise we booked an ""open"" future cruise on the understanding we could transfer the booking to another cruise and not lose any of the perks or the deposit, but when we tried to do that, were told the perks would not transfer! So trusting anything the people in future cruises told us was always going to be a slight problem. Once it was clear they were not answering our questions honestly (due to their not knowing answers and guessing) the ability to believe them was lost.So the on board experience overall was fantastic, however BEFORE sailing we had AGAIN experienced the dubious honesty of the company and in this regard I must issue a serious warning to anyone sailing with Celebrity - do NOT trust anything they  tell you and triple check EVERYTHING you do in regards to the booking and adding on board experiences. Our particular problem revolved around a drinks package offer they sent us two months before we sailed. In the advert they sent it stated 20% off drinks packages and when you clicked for the detail it stated $68.44 AU per day. Below the picture of some drinks it then added 'a 20% gratuity charge had been added to the price listed above.' The $68.44 also had a partially hidden statement under it stating terms and conditions applied, but when you clicked on the T & C's it referred exclusively to prices in US dollars and not AU dollars. I was still not 100% certain if the price included gratuities so rang Celebrity and asked. The first person I spoke to said it DIDN'T include gratuities but decided to ask his supervisor when I pointed out the line saying the price included them. His boss  said the price DID include gratuities so I asked if they would send me an email confirming that and he agreed immediately - but no email arrived. So I called back and got the same result, with one person saying they did and the other saying they didn't. With their own personnel not understanding their own advert and pricing I decided to ask my travel agent. She was pretty sure it DID include the gratuities but phoned HER Celebrity contact and they agreed it DID include them, so I booked the package.  And THIS is where it started to get nasty.The cart stated it had been added and that I now owed $1396 AU. It didnt point out how much that was per day - just as the advert never stated what the total would be for the 17 days, however by simple arithmetic I could see that 17 times $68.44 would be less than $1396. So I tried to contact the pre cruise contact address and got no reply. In fact there was NO number other than customer service  and they had been confused themselves so they would not be any good to sort this out.  In desperation I went to Celebrities Facebook page and messaged through there and to cut  along story a little shorter I received an email from someone trying to sort it out. However they simply stated the $1396 was correct and gratuities HAD been added to the $68.44. Again I will cut this short, because despite DAYS of back and forth (because they wouldn't give me a phone number to call) I could not get them to explain WHY it had said the 20% gratuities had been added to the figure above if it hadn't. They simply refused to accept their advert was misleading or explain why their own staff didn't understand the pricing.Eventually I had to contact the American parent and get them involved which resulted in my getting the price I had expected, though even THAT took the best part of another month!So, as I said earlier, count your fingers whenever you deal with the company because they find ways to be misleading if not downright dishonest and if you catch them out STILL wont accept they have been caught out. For what it is worth Fair Trading stated they had breached several accepted rules in their advertising, but they also know how to play the system, so it will take a long time for them to be stopped from doing it and when they are, they will simply find a new way to go about it anyway.For us,  despite the ship being among the best we have cruised on, we will probably never sail with Celebrity - or any of their parent, Royal Caribbean Lines, cruise ships again because of their inability to answer simple questions accurately..",Sail Date: September 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Hawaii|,Port Macquarie NSW

We flew into SEA the night before so we'd have plenty of time to get to the ship.  We arrived around 11:30 and boarding had started.  The walk from the Uber drop off area is about a quarter mile; however, it was a nice day so it wasn't bad.  Check in was a little crowded but the separate lines for suite passengers got us through very quickly.This was our second trip on Solstice.  It's a large ship but it's not difficult to navigate.  Our room was very spacious and well maintained.  There was plenty of storage.  We had a large balcony that was covered by an overhang.  A lounge chair on the balcony would be a nice addition.  I noticed that the bottom of the overhang was in need of paint.  Our room steward and butler were excellent.  They took care of everything that we needed.The food was excellent.  We ate most or our meals in Luminae.  They generally seated us in the same area so the servers were consistent.  They very quickly learned our preferences.  The food was very well prepared and we enjoyed everything we had.  We had dinner in Murano on one evening....it was also excellent.  We avoid the buffet but the food was decent the few times we ate there.We had access to Michael's Club, which provided us a concierge and open bar.  The concierge was very helpful and the servers were great.  As Captains Club Elite, we could also drink from a limited menu at any bar from 5-7 each evening, which was convenient.  We went to the designated Captains Club area one evening.  We didn't find the service there to be very good. It took quite a while to get a server.Entertainment on the ship was good.  We went to several shows and found them to be enjoyable.  Getting a seat at the late show was never a problemThe Alaskan ports on this cruise were very good.  We had great weather in Ketchikan and Skagway.  Unfortunately, Juneau was pretty much rained out.  I generally don't book cruise line excursions; however, Celebrity had offered some significant discounts for booking ahead so we did.  We enjoyed both of the ones we took. Unfortunately, our trip in Juneau was cancelled.  We never get off in Victoria...it's really a waste of time for a few hours in the evening.  It would be better to have the entire day.Disembarkation was easy.  We stayed an extra night in Seattle so we didn't have to rush to the airport.  The concierge walked us off at our desired time.  The line for taxis was long so we walked back to the Uber area and a car was ready in a couple of minutes.The only significant problem was with our bill.  Because one of our excursions was canceled, we ended up with a credit at the end of the trip.  It wasn't properly processed so the full amount wasn't credited back to our card.  Our travel agent found the correct number for customer service and took care of it promptly.Overall, we enjoy Celebrity.  It's about the last of the large ship lines that we'll sail.

They obviously take pride in the cleaniless. They also offer to clean your room twice a day. The staff was very friendly and nothing negative to say except with one of the issues we had.There were plenty of activites on board and there was always something going on that would appeal to everyone. For dining, we ate both at the buffett and the dining room. While it was exceptionally clean, the food was good in parts but you could tell it was mass produced. Obviously something they have to do so unfortunately the food wasn't exceptional or good, it was average. Even the dining room, there were issus with either not very warm food, poor presentation, and bland taste. For example, one of the meals was Beef Wellington which comes in the puff pastry. Puff pastry should be nice and crisp but it was pretty soggy and took on the texture of the meat. It wasn't horrible, but like I said the food was pretty average.For the ports, we had Ketchikan, Juneau, and Skagway. We were not impressed with Ketchikan or Juneau. Both have more jewelry stores per capita than probably anywhere in the world. Once you've been in one shop then you've seen all the goods any gift shop has to offer. Don't know what exactly I was expecting but I assumed there would be more variety. We counted 8-9 jewelry stores in a row walking down the block. Both towns didn't really have an Alaska or wilderness feel and both felt just like a money grab.Skagway was beautiful. There were still jewelry stores but they blended in with the town. It actually had it's own character and even though it was small, I'd rather spend the whole time there than in Juneau. I highly recommend the Kroschel Wildlife Refuge excursion if you like animals.One of the of main points of us coming on the trip was to go Dog Sledding on the Mendenhall Glacier. It's a $1240 excursion for two people but if you read the reviews, it's a one in a lifetime experience and something that comes highly recommended. We spent the 4K to book the cruise and the additional cost for the shore excursion. We are from the Seattle area so most of the other excursions we can do from home. We can go whale watching, we can do zip lining, we can run to the store and grab fresh salmon. What we can't do is go dog sledding on a glacier. Unfortunately, it got canceled due to weather that day and we found out a couple hours prior to arriving at the port.We went down to the Shore Excursion desk and the Guest Relations. They said we could book a new excursion and were happy to offer us the rest of the excursions at a higher price than what we would have pre ordered. I explained to them that basically we paid 4K to go on a trip when our sole purpose to go got canceled and they could care less. The attendent told us that ""Shore excursions aren't mandatory to go on."" I get that... But why else would you go to Alaska then? I'd rather spend the money going to Sandals and sitting on a beach.This is also a pretty crappy thing to say to someone who just spent 4K booking the cruise and spent additional money on board. I asked if we could get a discount or at least the price that we would have originally paid for a shore excursion if we prebooked and they it wasn't their fault and they wouldn't be doing anything. I don't know if it was the worker's fault or company policy, but obviously this left a bad taste in our mouth. We were treated like we can just book a 4k cruise every week and try again for the excursion next week. When things like this happen, the company has a great opportunity to get customer loyalty. Throw in a discount on a shore excursion that they make money on anyway, throw in $100 on board credit, hell, throw in free wifi for an hour or something. What really was poor was that we spoke to some other people who experienced the same thing and some of them got offered a discount. In all, Celebrity really didn't do anything to stand out or make us want to come back. I can't say I'd recommend them over any cruise line and we'll likely try a different one next time.",Sail Date: September 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Alaska|,

Booked via Costco and received many perks other cruisers did not receive so start there if you are a member. Celebrity Solstice is an elegant but large ship and did not disappoint anywhere. Our cabin (Concierge Class) was large with many small upgrades (sheets, pillows, shower head etc) and lots of storage. Buffet was large and inclusive with many choices and as a large buffet was above average, Main Dining room experience was good. We did not have a bad meal... but we did not rave about one either. We did anytime dining which worked out well.  $$$ xtra dining restaurants did impress but for an upcharge per person. Premium beverage package had a lot of perks other than liqueur so check that out. Itinerary wise this was a great first Alaska cruise and would highly recommend for a taste of Alaska. Excursions of course make the trip and they range from simple bus trips to kayaking to salmon fishing and more. Weather is a critical success factor on this cruise and we lucked out with sunny skies every day making it an unbelievable experience.

The ship is clean and well maintained, and this 7 night cruise to Alaska was spectacular due to the incredible, unforgettable beauty of Alaska.That being said, Celebrity wants to up-charge for EVERYTHING and the rest of the crew is constantly and aggressively trying to sell you on anything they can.  After spending a substantial amount of money for a balcony room, getting badgered like we were on a used car lot was an unwelcome distraction. We bought the premium non-alcohol beverage package ($184 per person) in order to not have to pay additional fees for bottled water, soft drinks and coffee and tea in the coffee shop.  We were harassed repeatedly about spa services, special lunches, additional drink packages, and more.  Celebrity needs to change this because we have cruised before on both Royal Caribbean and Carnival and this was, by far, the worst on board experience that we have had cruising, both in terms of the over aggressive sales techniques and because we got sick and tired of the nickel and diming.Our other complaint was the food quality itself.  The food in the main dining room is mediocre.  One night, we sprang for the add-on Tuscan Grille, which was very good and was in a beautiful setting - and cost $250 for four people. The Oceanview Cafe is terrible.  The pizza there is good, and the beer battered fish.  They offer a number of dishes that feel like ""leftover casserole.""  For example, one choice was baked ziti with cheese - and it was full of leftover carved ham.  Another time, on consecutive nights, they had ""butter chicken"" pizza and some kind of weird lasagna with Indian flavors in it.  Garam masala, cumin and caraway seeds are weird choices for Italian dishes, and they were unpleasant.For a 5.5 star ship, the food should have been much better.  In addition, because Celebrity has chosen to make most of the restaurants on Solstice pay-to-play, there is inadequate seating and long lines during all peak times (from 8 AM to 10 AM, noon until 2 PM and from 5;30 PM until about 8:30 PM).Alaska is beautiful.  Victoria is beautiful.  The scenery saved the vacation, but we will not sail on Celebrity again.",Sail Date: August 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Alaska|,St Charles

Many great positives including not in any order of priority: 1. Alaska is beautiful and you get an appreciation for the beauty of nature and the need to preserve this treasure for future generations 2. The ship program included many activities all day and for various tastes. I suggest you try many even if you do not normally do, as you may come to like new experiences. 3. Very helpful staff and every one of the crew was courteous; the ship did a great job of selecting their crew, 4. There is indoor pool which is great for Alaska trip in case it is cold, plus two outside swimming pools (though the pools are on the smaller size), 5. Great nightly entertainment; really enjoyed those, 6. Ship arranged for nice excursions; we took the sea plane in Juneau and had great views of the five Ice Glaciers; the ship used Wings Airways and we were very happy with that experience, 7 Great food (although I wish there were more variety of sea food in the buffet), 8. Buffet always clean and with amply of silverware and clothes napkin available always and everywhere. 9. Public toilets always amazingly clean and had someone cleaning them all the time, with plenty of towels (but toilets had what I thought weird design; you had to close the cover in order to flush). 10. Room service excellent.  Now to some of the negatives, again not in any order of importance: 1. Cabins are on the small size. If you are going like we did with two active teenagers, you need two cabins or a large suite. We had a balcony cabin, but it was on the small side 2. There is little activity for tweens; most activities require a minimum age of 16, even if ping pong tournament or basketball or volley ball. So, there is plenty for those over 16 and there is care for very young ones. If you have kids ages 12-16, they will be denied some activities, 3. There was a bit of sale of packages, especially on the first day, 4. No dedicate operator on phone. If you dial a zero to get an operator, you are sent to guest relations, but those are often busy and you had to wait your turn for a question that could be very simple, 5. Putting green on top very rough and not smooth; you really cannot do putting here, and they only had two putters and two balls, 6. Had to often re-register for the internet on the ship when I shut my iphone sometimes.

Why?  Finding fun things to do, other than shopping and gambling did not exist, so that if someone is on the cusp of 21 years of age. there is really nothing for them to do.Nickel and diming never makes me happy. There is a charge for everything, even if you are at the Concierge level. Navigating your bill is enough to send you through the atmosphere.However, I enjoyed my massage and the Mixology class, the Martini Bar required an extra add-on (as we had the drink package, but NOT the premium drink package!), but thank god it was there as it made the vacation.

We will be booking with Celebrity again and trying to see which ship Captain Tasos. He was the most personable and accessible Captain we have every sailed with in our 27 years of cruising together. It was reflected in his crew and their willingness to serve our needs with a smile and great service. We did the Alaskan Glacier Cruise from Seattle and back, with stops in Ketchikan, Skagway, Juneau and Victoria BC, Canada. We did wonderful and exciting excursions in each stop except Victoria where just stayed on the quiet ship and enjoyed the spa when everyone else seemed to be off the ship. I am posting separate reviews for our three big excursions. The rest of this review is what I wrote directly to Celebrity when I reviewed the cruise after when got home.Paul at the Passport bar was super. I had stopped there to get a couple Coke Zero for wife and I before getting ready for the evening. Paul took my order and after checking his stock told me he was out of it, but would be back in a moment. When he returned he told me that his stock was out, but he would be back in a few minutes. But he came back several minutes later with my Coke Zeros and a couple more for when I might be back he said.Another crew member that deserves special recognition was Kadek. He was the stateroom attendant who worked the next set of rooms near my stateroom. The phone call button for my attendant Pria was not working. On at least 4 occasions when I had a question or need, I would poke my head out of my stateroom and Kadek was usually by his rooms and answered my question and /or directed me to what I needed. He was always pleasant, smiling, very helpful and never acted like I was imposing on him. Whenever we passed in the hallway he was always smiling and said ""hello"". He was on my route to the elevators, so I saw him often.This was our first time on Celebrity and also having ""open seating"". Not being sure of the process we headed up to deck 4 and port side entrance to the dining room. It was our lucky night. Nataliya was the Restaurant Hostess on duty. She was excellent. She took the time to explain how it worked with ""Open seating"" and making reservations. Our traveling companions were to tired that night to join us for dinner and I had expected them to handle/explain dinner seating. This was their 4th Celebrity cruise. We were seated at a table for two and had a lovely dinner. On my way out after dinner, I stopped and asked Nataliya about making a reservation for the following evening for the six of us in out party. She told me she could have a table for six at 8:15. Again, good luck struck, but more about that next paragraph. After, dinner on the second night, I again stopped and asked Nataliya if she could arrange for that same table and servers for the rest of the cruise for dinner, she spent a couple of minutes on her computer and then told, yes, it was arranged. I also saw Nataliya for most breakfasts and lunches, she even had to remind me about my ball cap a couple of times. She always met us with a smile.Our servers we special, which was why after our first time with them I asked  Nataliya for them to be our servers for the rest of the cruise. Taisiya and Joffy were fabulous. Very attentive without being bothersome. Taisiya was very knowledgeable about the items on the menu along with the ""Specials"". Several times I went with her recommendation for dinner. Taisiya and Joffy were very attentive to my wife's special menu-gluten free. Also, Anthony our Maitre D' who came by near the end of every meal to take her order for the following day. Twice he even brought a specially made gluten free dessert for my wife. Joffy always made sure she had her gluten free bread near the time we got of regular dinner breads. We also had Joffy as part of our breakfast servers on level three. He would automatically bring my wife gluten free toast each morning. Taisiya and Joffy were excellent in their serving capacities. They met with a smile each evening and genuinely seemed happy to see each night. On a couple of night t was my wife and I for dinner. Nataliya made sure we sat in Taisiya and Joffy section. We were very happy with the quality, taste and presentation of our meals. One evening when Anthony came to take my wife order for the next day, she had noticed that they were serving Eggplant Parmisian. She asked Anthony if there was any way the Chef could make a gluten free Eggplant Parmisian for her meal, even though it was a starter. Anthony got on his phone and called back to the chef and came back with an affirmative. It was excellent and made my wife very happy.Once we got to a stateroom I was looking through the spa information and noticed the Persian Garden. As a regular cruise on Carnival we usually stay on their Spa Deck and enjoy this type of amenity. I called the Spa and they told me I had to purchase the Persian Garden in the Spa. So my wife and went up to the Spa. While we were there we decided to take advantage of embarkation special and each got a massage, plus I had already booked a prepaid for another for each of us prior to the cruise. Kate (Spa manage?) we so helpful and attentive to my wife and I for the entire cruise and knew us by name after our first visit. We both enjoyed our embarkation massages so much we asked Kate if she could rearrange the schedule to allow us to have the same masseuses, Musni for me and Roxana for her, for our next massages.This is getting long and I’m getting tired, but I did need to mention Pratik from “The Studio”. He was gracious and a masterful photographer. We purchased a set of 5 shots from him that we will treasure.Paul at the Passport bar was super.

We booked an outside balcony in Concierge class.The arrival experience was amazing comparing to the slow lines in Houston and Galveston. We practically flew to the ship.The lunch area reserved for Concierge made it really easy to unpack and eat with minimal fuss.We pre-booked our first dinner night at Murano (we've seen how backed up the primary dining room gets on the first night) and the food and service were amazing (and we got a large discount).Overall I'd say the main dining room was good but not amazing. Our first cruise on Royal set the bar very high. However, our servers and sommelier did a great job.The buffet was organized well until you add passengers from all backgrounds. It's clear that many folks don't pay attention and do have the slightest idea how a queue works. I did like the custom omelets and stir fry. Also the individual pizzas were pretty good. The star of the buffet was clearly the ice cream as the long was always long (maybe add another station?). The main downfall was the desserts. They were often flavorless and the tends tended to be dry.One of the biggest positives was the quality of the servers. On previous cruises I waited in long lines to get a drink. This was the complete opposite. We'd find a table and very shortly a server would come for our drink orders. It didn't matter if it was in a bar or getting coffee. Absolutely awesome experience.Getting on and off the ship for excursions was easy and took just a few minutes.We did the town tour, wildlife and totems in Ketchikan. It would be firmly in the ok category.Juneau was sled dogs (Matt the musher is a must-see!) and the Mendenhall glacier. The only downside is I wish the bus driver would have suggested the long trial to the waterfall. We were there a short time and this would have helped.Skagway we did whale watching and train tour. Both of these were excellent. We saw Orca and Humpback whales. The whole crew was awesome. Same with the train!Our last stop was Victoria and I wish we had a full day. I love Canada and the locals were super friendly and helpful. I would go there again just for a vacation.Celebrity needs to fix the quality of their Internet. With speeds in Kilobits per second, it was only worth the money to avoid toll changes and use Facebook messenger. For the price I paid, it would be much better. They also need to have a mobile app that has the complete schedule and ship layout (along with free on-ship only wifi) to make navigation easier without the paper schedules. This needs to be done 5 years ago!Overall I would rate my experience very close to my first cruise with Royal.

The first was from Seward south to Vancouver.  This was round trip Seattle.  I much prefer the one way itinerary.  You really never get to see mainland Alaska on this round trip and really miss a lot.  You see coming back just what you saw going up.  We did this one because the couple we were travelling with really wanted to see Victoria Island.Our room was a Concierge class balcony on 10.  Other than a welcome lunch we never saw any real benefit to being Concierge class.  The one problem I had with shore excursions he was unable to help with.The good:  Service was terrific from the main dining room staff, sommelier and maitre d to the room steward and the guys at the Martini bar.  The food in the main dining room was fabulous.  There is no reason to pay extra for specialty dining.  This was the best food ever on a cruise { we've done 6).  Their beef dishes were weak, but the fish, chicken and pasta were all wonderful. The buffet was terrific as well. The only disappointment there was the pastries which were dry and not very tasty.  Great views and service.  Embarkation and debarkation were fine.  Everybody we dealt with were very pleasant and anxious to help.  We had the standard drink package as a perk and it was good but I upgraded to the premium and it was great and only cost $72.  I think I got that back the first day.The house band and orchestra are very good.The not so good.  The ship is showing its age.  Carpet on our floor really needed replacing.  Our friends had a broken chair in their cabin.  It needs refreshing.  There was no vibe or buzz on this ship.  Except for the Martini Bar, the bars were all dead and understaffed.The cruise director Lewis, was totally lame.  Except for Shades of Buble, the shows were blah.  No adult comedy, late night shows.  No big late night dessert extravaganza.  Not a lot in the way of recreation or engaging activities.  I wish somebody would explain the stupid lawn to me.All the travel agents and cruise experts like to talk down Carnival but I have always enjolyed Carnival cruises (just wish the boats weren't so huge).  They are lively, lots more fun and way more interesting.

It took me weeks to plan every detail of this once in a lifetime bucket list trip that departed June 21, 2019.Upon embarkation to the ship, we were escorted to a beautiful lunch that was included in the concierge package.  When we arrived at our stateroom, we should have had a welcome bottle of champagne and fruit display, a key holder for the ship card and a tote bag.  NOTHING!  I asked the steward and he said the champagne was in the mini frig in the room.  Really??  No display??We soon discovered that the quality of the food was mediocre at best in regular dining.  In order to have a good cut of meat or shellfish and better service, you had to make arrangements at one of their specialty restaurants.  We ended up eating at the specialty restaurants quite a bit at quite a cost to us.The drinks were very good, if you could get one.  The ship seemed understaffed for the volume.My room had a broken blow dryer, the A/C barely kept the room comfortable, the patio was dirty and the furniture old and mismatched.At no time did we see our ‘concierge’.  I thought by booking this room, I would have been attended to.  NOT ONCE!I booked all of the excursions through Celebrity.  Getting off at port was a logistical nightmare and very disorganized and confusing.  If I didn’t ask at least 3-5 people who didn’t even work for the ship where to go we would still be sitting on those piers.In summary, I was very disappointed in the quality of service and food on the Celebrity Solstice.  I did not once feel special or tended to, except by our waiter Constantin in Murano’s specialty restaurant.Alaska was magnificent in its beauty, but I cannot say the same about the Celebrity Solstice.",Sail Date: June 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Alaska|,"Little Falls, New Jersey"

But you can start eating and exploring ship right away.Cabin: A little small with limited storage space, but very functional and was OK for 4 6-feet adults. We used our small refrigerator for water. Definitely need cabin with veranda, when you are going to Alaska.Food: We felt that there was no reason to try specialty restaurants for $35-50 per person because food in general/free restaurants and buffet was great with multiple healthy options, including vegetarian and vegan. In general dining restaurant appetizers are mostly very small, so you may need 2-4, entree were OK size. Desserts were great. Our waiter provided information about dishes size. Drinks: There is no reason for alcohol beverage package unless you plan to drink more that 8-9 beers. We took classic wine package - 7 bottles for $249 plus gratitude, which comes to about $300 for 7 bottles - enough for 7-day cruise. Not cheap, but wines were good and we enjoyed it. Remember you can bring 2 bottles of wine per cabin. Fitness: Good size gym that is open 24 h a day. We did not have any problems even during rush hour. Sauna was also free and good size, but some other things like aromatherapy were available for additional fee, $200 per couple for 7 days. We did not use spa. Typical cruise level prices.Service: Great stuff that is very eager to please you. Cruise company charge tips automatically $14.50 per person per day. We payed extra to our room guy and restaurant waiters. Captain: Very funny greek guy, who was loved by everybody.Entertainment: Probably the best we ever seen on the cruises including great dancers and singes as well as eastern European acrobats. Cruise company provided great educational lectures about ports and wild life. Would recommend not to miss these presentations. Talks about ports were about history, and not about shopping. Shore excursions: We booked everything in advance, not through the ship company. Ketchikan is good for float plane trip, Juneau is great for helicopter flight, but ours was canceled and we went on whale watching trip, which was great. In Skagway we elected private tour, which was great because we were able to see a lot in 6 hours including drive to Carcross Desert and Emerald Lake. We met bear too. Victoria is good for a long walk. A lot of things can be organized right when you get off the ship except probably helicopters and private tours.Conclusion: Great ship with great company.

We were first time cruisers so were expecting some assistance in where to go and what to do but we had to find out for ourselves as the crew were too busy trying to hard sell upgrades to food and drinks. When we first saw the ship it looked huge and thought we would never get round to seeing all of the ship but we saw it all on the first day.Our first full day was at sea and the weather was dull, so we went to see what entertainment was available. It was disappointing to find out there was none apart from being told about a bit of history about our first port of call, Ketchikan and where the best place to go to buy diamonds and gold, which is ok if you are a millionaire, the lady doing the presentation must have been on a good commission. The food on the ship was good and plenty of it although the coffee machines in the cafe at breakfast were always empty and did not get filled up quick enough. The security getting back on the ship after an excursion was good. The stateroom we were in was nice and our stateroom cleaner was very nice and looked after us very well. There was no tea and coffee making facilities in the room which we thought was not very good. There were several lifts which we feel like we spent a day waiting for a lift due to the number of people. Again when we were at sea there was no real entertainment.

Starting from a secondary class airport we always get to our starting port at least a day early.We came three days ahead to do some things in Oahu we have missed on previous trips. April 29th was the embarkation.it went smooth enough. Stayed in Honolulu an extra night. Then left for Maui following day. Maui is a beautiful island so green and people were very friendly and willing to help tourists find their way around. We did the town the first day. Stayed overnight there anchored off the coast. Yes it is a tender port. Gladly so do to the amount of destruction that would occur if a docking port was built. I have snorkeled at ports just finished construction. The sea bottom has been turned upside down.   Wife and I had made plans to go to Lan`i the millionaires island. We meet our sail boat at the pier.Sail Maui is an awesome group to take you to several dive spots. It was to late to see whales but dolphins were everywhere. Lan`i is a great little island to go to, if other islands are booked up to get to. Snorkeling was great in the bay that we were dropped in.   Setting sail for the Big Island. That night the Captain told us we would be able to see the volcano eruption as we went by that area. Most of the passengers were on the open deck at 11 something,but by 12:20 most had given up to see it.The time the ship did pass the spot was after 2 AM. Captain had his calculations a bit off.   We were able to tie up at the Big Island port of Hilo. We left the ship early in the morning to do a trip to the water falls. We did not book it with the ship. It was so much less to go find a taxi and tell the driver what you want to do. We got lucky to have a gal that was very happy to share the best way to accomplish what we wanted to do. We got to see all the waterfalls in that part of the island. It was a lot of walking. We started at 7:30 and got back to the ship around 11:30. We cooled out for a bit until lunch time. At 12:35 we were in the buffet and the whole ship started shacking like the ship was trying to set sail. But it was much stronger,the plates and dinner ware were rattling on tables. There were ripples in the water as each tremor hit coming off the hull of the Solstice. It was a 7.1 quake and the volcano started covering homes with lava.   We left the Big Island on way back to Oahu port. The disembarkation was bad in 2006 when we left the Mercury in Alaska. Some of  the Celebrity porters in Vancouver had taken all the luggage off  the ship in wrong order.Gladly we had booked our flight home in the afternoon. Hundreds of other passengers did not have that luck. The Celebrity Solstice was responsible for all those folks missing their flights. What a mess!  Well sad to say the disembarkation of the Solstice was all fouled up also.This company still has no clue how to fix the problems. Passengers were in the places on the ship where they were asked to wait for their numbers would be called. Why in Helll`s name would they call all the numbers all most at the same time.People were standing for what seemed like forever in the halls leading to the gangway.What would be the worst time ever leaving a vessel after a cruise. The food was pretty average in the dinning room  and the service was very slow taking almost 2 hours to eat dinner some nights. I also had never seen so many rude crew members reactions to passengers.    Mediocre food, worse service,bad attitudes of crew, worse disembarkation ever,pretty sad entertainers all have lead us to the decision, NEVER to take Celebrity Cruise Line ever again.",Sail Date: June 2018|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Hawaii|,"Boise, Idaho"

I have never cruised with Celebrity before. I was quite impressed. I am writing this review because I had a lot of questions before hand and couldn't easily find answers. So I am posting lots of info and pictures. We got 2 balcony rooms with an unobstructed view. They opened up the balcony divider, so we could roam between the two rooms freely, and this made the balcony way bigger! For the Alaskan Cruise, the balcony view is so worth it! When we cruised through the Tracy Arm Fiord, we got to enjoy all the glaciers and ice from the comfort of our room. The ship and room were super clean! I have been on another cruise and the hallways smelled like vomit. Our room attendant was Ankur. He was very attentive and helpful. The ship holds 2,842 guests, but I never found it to feel crowded. The buffet got a little crowded on at sea days, but other than that, there was tons of room everywhere. The kids drop off area, Fun Factory, was okay. The kid's staff was amazing, but the facility was really small and limited. I didn't find this ship to be very family friendly. My 4 year old was in a different room/group than my 7 year old. She didn't like that she was separated. I also noticed that there were not many families on the ship. I would say around 10% were families with young children. It was too cold to swim in the outdoor pools. But they opened up the indoor adults only pool for family pool hours every day. This was really nice. My kids enjoyed swimming indoors. The Grand Epernay dining was good. The Oceanview buffet was a great option and way easier for my family. My kids loved getting ice cream and soft serve ice cream here everyday! Cafe Bacio had amazing coffee (for fee) and great pastries (for free). We had the classic beverage package that was a free perk with the group we booked with. The only annoying thing was that in order to get bottled water, you had to go to a bar to get it and you only got one bottle per room key. We did not try any of the upgraded restaurants. Includes soda, fresh squeezed juices and bottled juices, premium coffee and teas, and non-premium bottled water, all beers priced at $6.00 or less, all cocktails and frozen drinks priced at $8.00 or less, and all wines at $9.00 or less a glass.",Sail Date: July 2018|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Family (young kids)|Destination: Alaska|,

Every stop you were met with genuine  smiles and glasses of mimosas or wine.  The food was the best I have eaten on all of my cruises (7).  Along the cruise the announcer would let you know when and where sightings were and the lectures before the stops were great.  This  trip had very little children and young adults on it .  You could actually  hear and enjoy the times at the outside bars and terraces.  Don't get me wrong about family time with the kids  but this was about relaxing and discovery.  Activities  we enjoyed were  Dog sled  riding in Skagway , Zip-lining , Shopping in Ketchikan and the salmon runs there.   We left from Vancouver  and ended up in Seattle. Both cities have way to much to list to visit. By the way if you do pick an  Alaskan cruise you need to get  a balcony  room.  My brother-in-law had one and we hung out there  .

The cruise started in Auckland, New Zealand and finished in Perth, Western Australia where our son lives. The 16 day cruise called in 4 ports in NZ and 4 in Australia including Perth.The Solstice was the biggest cruise ship we have been on to-date. The outside balcony cabin was a decent size, nicely appointed and with a nice balcony sitting area. We had prebooked fixed dining on a table for 6 which worked out well for us. Food in general was very good, well worth asking for extra vegetables otherwise limited amount served. On the whole the theatre entertainment was good, mainly Australian, NZ and British artists.The solarium pool was really nice especially as the weather was a little indifferent. They have an unusually demonstration on the top deck, glass blowing. Also, there is a real grass lawn.The only criticism we would level is the continual pestering to have a specialist dining experience in one of their specialist dining restaurants. I would also point out that they like to have regular closed door cocktails and bites for their Captain Club members. Whilst this is fine it's annoying when they shut-off popular sitting areas to other passengers.

Our itinerary began in Seattle, then included a stop in Ketchikan, a view of Tracy Arm Fjord, a stop in Juneau, a stop in Skagway, and a short stop in Victoria British Columbia, then back home to Seattle. Seattle: We flew in the night before and stayed at the new Embassy Suites downtown. We went to Chihuly Garden and Glass and took a ride up the space needle. Afterward, we decided to get a bite to eat and ended up having the best pizza of our lives! I seriously regret this decision because every slice of pizza I've had since then has been compared to the perfectly wood-fired pepperoni gloriousness @ Bambino's. I highly recommend hiring a private company to take you to the pier. Uber and Lyft are not allowed to get close and have a separate loading space. We hired a car service, but he took us right up to the curb. There was nothing special or unspecial about Pier 91 - they have it down pretty well there. We boarded with ease, got ourselves a drink and relaxed while waiting for embarkation. Leaving the port of Seattle was beautiful from the very first moment. Unlike Galveston, the views are fantastic. Ketchikan was a quaint little town that really caters to visitors. We did the crab boat tour from an outside company and really enjoyed learning about deep sea fishing. The captain and crew were all great; knowledgeable, personable, and accommodating. They had a way of making every passenger feel special. We got to visit a bald-eagles nest and the captain threw fish overboard to attract the eagles which came within inches of our reach! It was quite a sight to see.In Juneau we visited the glacier, hiked in the rainforest, and went whale watching. It was a great day of adventure that didn't disappoint. Skagway was such a fun little town! We went on a Zip-lining tour and ziplined our way down the mountain. Incredible!!! Then, we had time to do some shopping in town. It was so neat to learn about the history of this little jewel of a place. I hope to visit there again! Our last stop was in Victoria and we didn't have much time there so we went shopping in town and just enjoyed the local culture.As far as the ship itself: The entertainment on ship was great! We enjoyed the shows, the food was incredible (we ate at all of the specialty restaurants) and most importantly, the staff were amazing. They greeted us with champagne as we boarded and truly made us feel celebrated the entire time we were on the ship. The captain was hilarious and knows his stuff. At the glacier during the Tracy Arm Fjord, he did a 360 turn of the ship (with tight quarters) so everyone on board could view the glacier. Incredible!

DON’T TRAVEL IN OCEANIA,"This was our first time traveling in Oceania and in particularly we wanted to try the Insignia, since we were considering the 180 days world cruise in that same ship. We were on board for ~3 weeks during Xmas and New Years 2019 to 2020. We were 3 adults in a single outside cabin 3001. Our experience was a complete nightmare; from serving a cockroach in the salad to such a small cabin that it was not fit for 3 adults. Beware the 3 persons cabin are the same side as the 2 persons outside cabin. It was so terribly small that it became a hazard for my elderly mother to go to the bathroom at night and may her way without tripping. We ended up with multiple bruises since it was hard to move without hitting yourself in such small cabin and bathroom. The incident with the cockroach on the salad was taken very lightly by the crew, and no special measure were taken. They continue to serve the same salad in the Terrace Cafe buffet even after we showed the waiters and chef the cockroach. We made an official report of the cockroach incident and to this date Oceania is not complying with our request to return the cost of the ticket fare. My sister that ingested part of the roach got terribly sick and we missed several ports because of it. The officer we spoked about the incident were not train in good customer service protocol and were quite rude. I would NOT recomend you traveling in Oceania. They have a lot to learn for maintaining health food  standards and good customer service. I would give them a minus 0 rating if available. The only kind people in the crew were the waiters in the restaurants and buffet. All the officers need to be reminded they are in the customer service business and not in the navy. .",Sail Date: December 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: Family (multi-generational)|Destination: Caribbean|,

The ports were so-so.Two disappointments compared to previous cruises were the food quality and onboard presentations by ""jewelry specialists"" that encouraged folks to go to Oceania's recommended and guaranteed shops at the port, which were only 3 - the ""specialist"" met us at Diamonds International in Honduras and we spent 2 hours with her and the manager.  Needless to say, we ended up  purchasing an expensive pair of earrings, being told about the 5 year, no interest, minimum $50 month payment.  By the time we got home, and received the statement for the earrings, one month later, the minumum payment was over $500.

Her only complaint is about the size of the bathroom.It is a one person at a time facility and extremely small.The concierge cabin has several benefits that were very pleasing to us.  One is three bags of complimentary laundry, and the pressing of four items at embarkation.  It also included a cold bottle of champagne on embarkation day.  We always got a window table at lunch and dinner.All the staterooms now have smart TVs, so you can scan various ship amenities and services, along with your onboard account.  It has movies on demand.All of the staff were friendly, efficient and helpful.  From our room attendant, to the waiters, bartenders, and sommeliers, all were great.The dining was exceptional, especially in Polo Grill and Toscana.  Our waiter at Polo one evening noticed that my wife was wearing a black dress, so she gave her a black napkin so there would be no white cotton fluff residue.  It is attention to detail like this that makes Oceania so great.This being our fifteenth cruise, the two best waiters we have ever had have been on Insignia.  Roy, in Main Dining was friendly, and efficient.  He took the time to chat which we enjoy.  He told use what he was going to do and then did it.At the future cruise presentation, I was lucky in that my number was called in the raffle and we won $250 ship board credit.  We also got a $100 credit for booking our next cruise on Nautica in 2021.  We chose a penthouse to get a larger bathroom for my wife.Like most cruise lines the excursions are relatively expensive for what you get.  We skipped the port of Saguenay due to weather in which we had an excursion booked as one of our perks.  We later chose a more expensive excursion, but they comped us on the difference.As a surprise for my wife, I had our travel agent email a special dessert recipe for her birthday while on board.  The chef came out with the wait staff to sing to her and we had Swedish Creme with raspberries on top.  The guest speakers on board included a NASA engineer who gave incredible tales about the near misses and mishaps of Opollo Eleven and the planning of the space suit and trip to Mars.  There was a historian that dealt with the Caribbean and piracy, but her staccato delivery was distressing.  A jewelry designer masked her sales pitch as the history of the Central American Indians and their artifacts.Fred Klett was the comedian on this cruise and he had us all in stitches twice.We did not purchase a drink package because a glass or two of wine with dinner and a cocktail now and then is still cheaper than $120 a day for the premium package.One thing that we were kind of shocked to see was the flaunting of the Country Club Casual rules on Oceania.  They did not enforce them and guests took advantage of that fact.  You would see jeans and t-shirts in main dining in the evening.

The food was to a very high standard and most days there were variations on the lunch menu and in the evening when you were not in the speciality restaurants the menu varied slightly. Quite simply whatever you would like to eat was available somewhere on the ship 24/7. I read in another review criticism of the cruise director and in my experience that could not be further from the truth. I found Ray to be witty, engaging and kept the whole cruise buzzing along with information.

Then we stumbled upon Oceania-we typically Cruise RCCL , NCL and some Carnival ships and always a balcony. There was an offer to cruise this smaller more intimate ship at about the same price and it included airfare and a choice of shipboard credit or shore excursions.  It also included dining at two specialty restaurants, all we had to do was select INSIDE cabin, and for the price of a balcony of the others we were headed to Bermuda! We arrived and by far the youngest couple on board at late 40’s.  This is not a party boat or one for teenagers, think country club, with nice dinners, string quartets, tea in the afternoons, and everyone will know you before the end of your cruise. I can’t say enough about the staff, the food, and the accommodations, we were in an inside cabin(7040) and the bed, the linen, the Bulgari toiletries were amazing. We thought this would be a “stuffy” cruise and would not like the crowd.. Wrong!  One of the best vacations ever, the overnights in Bermuda, the access to areas and amenities without the extra charges were just great.  I tried to book again while we were on board, my wife really enjoyed the cruise and we are going back, she wants a balcony/suite which is about 2x our price paid, so we are back to NCL.  You simply have to try this cruise line, if you can manage the inside stateroom there are destinations all over the globe and doing the math you can not beat this cruise line for elegance, relaxed atmosphere, and amenities.

The crew which  I include as everyone working on the ship were outstanding and very friendly and accomodating.  There wasn't anything they wouldn't do for you.  Crossing the Atlantic to and from Bermuda was a little challenging for some due to rough seas.   Many of the crew and passengers got sea sick.  The food was very very good.  Where could you get lobster or steak or shrimp in a buffet for lunch and dinner?  Answer Insignia.  My only gripe was the booking of excursions and dining thru the main office.  I was put on a wait list and had called once a week for 6 weeks before the ship sailed to find out if I was off the wait list.  Each time I was told there was no change.  Arriving on the ship I immediately went to the excursion desk and explained what had been going on.  The receptionist told me that all excursion tickets were in my room and that there were numerous overbookings.  This was due to now being off the wait list.  How was that possibe since I had called 3 days before the ship left and was told no change.  I now had to unbook excursions that I filled in to take the place of the wait list ones.  The same thing happened for restaurant reservations.  Main office said there were no openings the entire week until after 8pm for speciality dinners. Again, after arriving I went to the reservation desk and the girl asked me what day and time I wanted. I guess corporate does not know what is going on.  The other disappoinging thing was the cancellation of one of the excursions.  On the ships brochure it states their is no cancellation of excursions come rain or shine, however, mine was cancelled due to rain which never occured and there was no refund. The entertainment was fantastic!Granted the bathroom was small and the shower even smaller but the room and bed were quite comfortable.

A 21 day Med cruise, It was fantastic!  This was largely due to the fact that Peter Roberts was the Cruise Director and his partner Jason Parsons was the Assistant Cruise Director, they were amazing.  The food and service on Riviera was also amazing and due to this experience the folks that I met on the Riviera decided to book Insignia 14 day Caribbean. Thank goodness we were with 6 other friends, or we could not have bared the thought of 2 weeks on this ship.  Where to start...let's start with the biggest problem, the cruise director!  We disliked him so much, we can't even remember his name, we believe it was Ray. We heard the guy on the loud speaker announcements daily and didn't get to see him until day 5.  We tried to be friendly with him and one person in our party went over to him to see if he was going to sing at karaoke or not - the Cruise Director was staring at his phone all through the event.  He looked up at the person in our group and very sarcastically said - ""I hire singers, I don't sing"", then went straight back to his phone.  All of us were dumbfounded!  Believe it or not, it got worse, he then went over to the bartenders and started pointing and laughing at our group - we had no idea why, perhaps he thought his sarcastic remark to a gentleman in our group was funny????  Disgusting!!!  Remember, when traveling as a group of 8 on Oceania we spent over 50K for the two week cruise - this type of behaviour should not be tolerated. School children are better behaved!The food quality, in my personal opinion, has dropped since we cruise on Riviera in 2017. On Riviera, the quality and selection were extremely good - especially in the specialty restaurants.  On Insignia however they were marginal.  My entree in Toscana was horrible - how on earth can you mess up a plate of pasta?  The pasta in the buffet was 100% better.  I went to culinary school for 2 years, and believe and am qualified enough to remark on the food quality.* The buffet was mediocre and repetitious. * The main dining room was the best place to eat, but again, the quality was not up to par* Bar Services at all venues were quite good This ship underwent a dry dock very recently and it appears they just concentrated on the cabins and updated the furniture and carpet in the public areas.  On the pool deck the boards were loose and warped.  I watched more than one person take a stumble on it.  There were very elderly people on this, you would thing that Oceania would spend the money to fix the teak deck.  The ship also looks tired on the outside - lots of rust andOverall - Your World, Your Way - I think not.  This will be our last Oceania Cruise. The cost associated for this trip was NOT fulfilled in any way.  We have paid much less on Princess, Celebrity and Holland American and no longer see the benefits of this marketed ""UPSCALE"" line.

Why would one dock at an island on a public holiday – to get a discount in the docking fees?

The original itinerary was scheduled for Cuba, but due to the recent return of ""sanctions"", our entire itinerary was changed - no fault of Oceania's.  Rather than accept the full refund offered by the cruise line, we chose to accept the 50% discount off our Penthouse 1 Suite (third largest cabin with balcony) for the 10 day cruise of the Caribbean! When else would we be able to get the same suite at a 50% reduction on a ship of this quality?!  It was quite a deal and my only regret is that I didn't originally book a Vista or Owner's suite! With our own butler, a host of suite amenities and onboard credits, Oceania gratuitously awarded us for our loyalty.  Throughout the ship and duration of the cruise, service was excellent, smiles were genuine and standards uncompromising.  Oceania's reputation of having the finest food at sea was definitely confirmed. While the fine-dining specialty restaurants, Toscana and Polo, were comparable to the best available anywhere, the ""general"" eating areas Terrace and Main Dining offered consistent quality, wide selections that appealed to diverse palates, and relaxed dining experiences.  Having cruised on Silversea, Seabourne, Uniworld as well as the larger ships of Royal Caribbean, Princess and Carnival, Insignia's dining experiences are unmatched. Most memorable, however, is the obvious team spirit aboard this ship.  Coordinated by Ray and his spirited team of talented entertainers (Cherise, Lamont, Mason and Amy), their infectious energy, excitement and presence engaged, involved and embraced the diverse mix of cruisers aboard this small vessel.

We sailed from Syndey to Japan, then Japan to Singapore.  These combined cruises were considered our eleventh cruise.  We have found, over the years, that Oceania will advertise certain high-interest ports, only to cancel them before the sailing date.  Three that I remember are Cairo, Turkish ports and most recently South Korea.   I know that there are security problems that arise, but O seems to wait a little too long to decide to cancel these ports. Oceania also has a habit of canceling docking on the day of your visit because of weather-related problem.  We have not been on a single Oceania cruise where this has not happened.  Other than refunding any ship's excursion money, there is no other refund,  such as port fees that have been rolled into the cruise fare. For these reasons, we are looking at other cruise lines.

Most of its competitors, including RC and Celebrity are offering refunds, some even with additional incentives on future cruises. Azamara is supposed to be the luxury cruise line of the RC fleet. Luxury usually connotes higher quality of customer caring and a more flexible posture than lower ranked cruise lines. When Princess offers refunds and Azamara does not, that deserves mention on social media outlets, warning others of Azamara's out of step response. Plus Azamara is about to change its entire cruise style to primarily country intensive cruises in which we have no interest and the itinerary we purchased is NOT being repeated in  2021. This leaves us with virtually nothing of interest on Azamara to choose in 2021 due to this shift in cruise style. If you go to  Cruise Critic.com, you can compare Azamara's miserable response compared with others, even including its sister brands. Azamara is way out of the norm among competitors, most of which are giving refunds and even reductions on future cruises.

Food was great at their “Prime C Steakhouse”, the rest of Their Restaurants were all very average. Service was very spotty, but in some cases excellent.  Cruise Director Eric De Grey, was as good or better than any other Cruise Director on any past Cruise Ship we have traveled.  What was VERY disappointing was the condition of the ship both Inside and Outside.  It certainly is in need of a complete makeover.  Furniture throughout the Ship was showing much wear and tear, some of the Chairs and Sofas were Thread Bare and stains showing from past abuse Major scratches and gouges in much of the Wood.  Carpets throughout stained with the result of many spills and other things, just made us feel uncomfortable. The Outside of the Ship needed a complete REPAINT, paint was badly chipped, water and other Stains very visible, the name JOURNEY on the front of the ship had rust marks streaming down from it.. I have always associated AZAMARA with one of the Upscale Cruise Lines, with the condition of this Ship, it certainly does not meet this Standard any longer, She just needs a complete Makeover.

We had a great experience on Azamara and would not hesitate to return. If I were to compare it to our Celebrity experience:++) Definitely enjoyed the multiple days in port. Totally different experience when you know you don't have to rush back for a 6 PM departure. +) Smaller ship gets into smaller ports. Never were tendered on this trip.+) Never felt crowded- rarely ever had to wait, even for excursions+) Felt more like a boutique hotel than a Las Vegas casino+) Extremely efficient in most every function- excellent staff+) More healthy population - always people walking the stairs (I once kept track on Celebrity and made it up/down 70 flights throughout the day without every seeing another non-crew member despite having 3x-4x more passengers onboard.)-) Age demographics were definitely older. They say 55-57 but on our cruise I would put it closer to late 60's.+) Few to no children+) Felt the food was slightly higher quality but never experienced the ""feeding frenzy""-) Fewer specialty restaurants and main dining room was just OK+/-) A fairly good ""no extra charge"" alcohol selection, but a terrible beer selection. There was not one beer worth upgrading for. This is especially strange considering our voyage included a region with some of the best beers in the world- Belgium!+/-)Since Azamara ships are smaller you run in the same people much more often; those you like and those you like to avoid. *It may have only been my perception, however, many Azamara cruisers are ""way too"" obsessed with how you rank in your cruise total and extremely willing to challenge anyone with a differing opinion.+/-) Excursions are smaller in number & the disembarkation process was excellent. They are more expensive and feel roughly comparable in content. I had an issue with excursion listed as ""strenuous"" only to have multiple people on every one with limited mobility. While I try to be empathetic we often ended up missing sites or loosing our ""free time"" due to lagging behind schedule.+) Significantly more interaction with the officers/crew so you feel more connection to the ship and the cruise line** Going forward I would definitely choose a small ship and would not hesitate to go with Azamara, but may also explore other comparable cruise-lines.",Sail Date: August 2019|Cabin Type: Suite|Type of Trip: |Destination: Europe|,"San Diego, California"

The negatives: drink service by the pool (very small) was almost non-existent. We avoid the sun and tended to sit in the shade where fewer passengers lounged. The pool deck servers were far too few for the number of persons sitting in the lounge chairs (which was not a large crowd). Rather than waiting for a server to come to us, we had to go to the bar for our drinks. Not an easy chore for someone with a walking disability. Speaking of disabilities, my feet became infected and I was experiencing significant lumbar pain which will require surgery. The  ship's doctor instructed me not go on our planned excursions and he would notify the Excursion desk. The Excursion desk would not issue me a credit even though the ship's doctor told me to stay on board. Eventually the Excursion manager had to become involved for me to receive a credit. When I looked at our bill online, I noticed that I was granted a credit, but not my wife. Why? Because she did not have a medical condition that prevented her going on excursions. Again, we had to get the manager involved to explain that we came on the ship as a couple to enjoy the cruise, and we booked all the same excursions as a couple to enjoy. My wife reluctantly received an excursion credit. The food was average at best, and on special nights (Asian, Mexican, etc.) there was slim pickings for normal ""American food."" What was very annoying was the constant selling of future cruises. When I am eating my meal, I do not want a sales brochure pushed under my nose.

Everything was arranged by Azamara Cruise line. The Air portion was cheaper from them than if I had booked it myself. There were more days in the ports we visited and I loved it. I will definitely look at more cruises from now on where there are more days in port, rather than scurrying off to another port the next day. More time to explore and see things than the 'regular' one port a day cruise that is offered by most cruise lines these days.The AzAmazing evening was a delight. Three days in Charleston, South Carolina, and three days in Bermuda (that was cut short because of pending storms, so we left early to miss them) but enough time to see everything I wanted to. The Ship is a small ship, 700 passengers with nearly 1/1 service personnel. The lectures on our cruise were extremely good. The service from the crew was very good as well, no discontentment within the ranks (you can always tell). The Captain was the most personable Captain that I've ever met on a Cruise, he even hosted some of the events and was honest with his dealings about what was happening. To me, from my many cruise experiences, this was exceptional. The Cruise director was also exceptional.

A big thumbs up to the smaller cruise ships.  Embarkation was a breeze with no lines and no hassle.  The best way to describe the Journey is a boutique cruise ship.  It is smaller, with all sorts of small details of elegance, charm and class.  Our cabin was of average size but very nicely appointed.  My only complaint would be the size of the shower.  Consider it a challenge to avoid flooding the entire bathroom while showering!  The food was delicious.  Smaller portions at the buffet ensured hot meals instead of luke warm. There were plenty of options.  We ate dinner at all four venues, buffet, main,and both specialty restaurants.  Great portion size, ample selections and A plus service.The entertainment was exceptional. We thoroughly enjoyed the quest lecturers. One, Captain Les, was a retired Concorde pilot who facinated us with 5 sessions of the Concorde from birth to retirement.  Second was Betty Martin.  An amazing artist of unlimited talent who was responsible for the renovation of the angels sitting atop the Flat Iron building in New York.  The on board shows and comedians were the best.Saving the best for last...the gracious staff.  What a wonderful crew that do everything within their power to make sure that you have the best cruise ever.  From the bar staff to the Captain (who is so smart and capable) we have never experienced better service.

We drove to Miami because we wanted to have a car for the post-cruise spring training. It is a long drive, and next time we probably will fly (though we hate the MIA airport). We stayed at the Hampton Inn & Suites Blue Lagoon International Airport on a stay and cruise package that included parking and a shuttle.  That worked out fine compared with parking at the Port and saved us a little money and a good bit of hassle. It took only a few minutes to get through the formalities of paperwork including the Cuban visa ($75 per person), which Azamara took care of for us.Soon we were sitting in Journey's buffet restaurant, Windows, enjoying a drink. Drinks are included in the cost of Azamara cruises, but the included package mostly has only moderate and low-end brands and house wines. My wife decided to upgrade to the Ultimate package because she enjoys fancy craft cocktails -- unfortunately we would learn that, unlike some other lines many bartenders on Azamara are not up to speed on making complex, or even simple, drinks. One of my wife’s Old-Fashioneds looked and tasted like a Red Fanta. I stayed with the included drink package.Before long we went to our Deck 8 Veranda Stateroom (8004). Having read and heard a lot of reports, we were prepared for the stateroom to be on the small size, and the bath and shower to be tiny. The bathroom wasn't quite as small as I had feared, but I have to say that on a so-called premium ship that the shower is as small as it is. With my rheumatoid arthritis and back problems, it was not a pleasure to take a shower.Although the Journey is almost a 20-year-old ship (it was built in 2000 as an R-2 class ship for Renaissance Cruises, now defunct, and then sailed under two names for Pullmantur line), it appeared to be in quite good condition. We liked all the mahogany and other woods in some of the public areas and enjoyed going on several open decks as in the ""old days"" of cruising.Journey has one of the smallest swimming pools I've ever seen on a cruise ship, although there are plenty of deck chairs. The fitness room is pretty well equipped, although smallish and with only one recumbent bike.We found Azamara staff, both officers and guest-contact crew, almost uniformly helpful, friendly and hard working. That was the case although gratuities were included in the fare. (At the end of the cruise we did tip extra for our room steward, who was excellent, and a bartender who had been extra nice to us.)I have to admit that our overall experience may have been clouded by the fact that my spouse had a cold that started soon after boarding (after disembarking she went to a doc-in-the-box in West Palm Beach and was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and an eye infection.) A couple of days after board I developed a toothache that turned out to be sinus-related. None of this was Azamara's fault (we didn't hear of any noroviruses this trip), and we probably should have checked with the clinic on board, but its hours were limited.Dining was certainly adequate on board, but not exceptional. We usually ate in the main dining room, Discoveries, for dinner (everyone has open seating, and only once or twice did we have to wait a few minutes for a table). Some of our favorite dishes, such as the escargot appetizer, seem to be the same as on sister line Celebrity, but others were mediocre. Service was always excellent, however. One negative with Discoveries:  the ceiling is quite low, giving it a kind of closed-in feeling. We did try Prime-C, the steak house (a $30 per-person upcharge), which was fine but not memorable. The Windows buffet, again, was adequate but with a limited menu compared with other ships we've been on. The Patio on the pool deck, which serves burgers and such, was -- I have to say again -- only adequate.We loved our two days in Havana and wish we could have spent the entire cruise at Cuban ports. The Cubans we met were extremely friendly and open about the good and not-so-good things about Cuban society. We saw and heard little if any propaganda about Cuba.Why this itinerary included Cozumel I don't know. We have been to Cozumel many times, both on land trips and on cruises and no longer find it of any interest at all. It is a good dive destination that has been ruined by too many cruise ships and too much commercialization (Cozumel, amazingly, is the 3rd busiest cruise port in the world.) We were not that impressed with the ship excursion staff, who pushed the cruise tours pretty hard, gave us some wrong information, and one of our pre-booked tours was canceled for no reason we could understand.To summarize what we liked and didn't much care for:Liked:• Easy embarkation and disembarkation• Friendly, helpful staff• Lots of ""traditional"" wood paneling and such on this 20-year-old ship• The Havana stop -- Havana is amazing, and we only wish we had had more time there• We get points on Celebrity for Azamara cruisesSo-so:• Enrichment offerings (basically one speaker whose knowledge of parts of the Caribbean seemed a little dated -- having written many books on the region I probably knew more than he did)• Food• EntertainmentThe small-ship atmosphere -- Journey carries fewer than 700 passengers, but we really • felt that we had more and better options for places to relax on the Solstice-class Celebrity shipsDidn't like:• Cozumel • Bartenders' skill -- some bartenders seemed to have no training in making anything but the very basics. The Celebrity ships we have been on had much better bars and craft cocktails; the ship skimped on some ingredients, for example substituting cheap maraschino cherries for Luxardo cherries. I think Azamara should totally rethink its drink policies – just raise the fare a few bucks and make the included drinks cover more options and better brands.• Small stateroom, tiny bathroom and ridiculously little showerBottom line:  I guess our expectations were too high.  We were hoping to really love Azamara, but at this point I doubt we would go on another Azamara cruise. We prefer its big-ship sister line, Celebrity, and hope that Royal Caribbean's recent purchase of a majority interest in Silversea will result in a true premium line in the cruise family (we have been on Silversea and hope that Royal Caribbean upgrades to newer ships).Overall Cruise Rating:  B-",Sail Date: March 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Cuba|,"Asheville, North Carolina"

So you pays your money........I upgraded to a balconey room which, in hindsight, wasn't a good move as the balconies are small and we didn't use it.Entertainment - The Achilles heel.

This Sea Princess cruise was also  from UK to Australia Via the Panama.(50 nights) On the Sea Princess I found  drinks expensive $52.00 per bottle of wine. $15.00 for a gin etc. Stage shows whilst good were few and far between compared with a show on each and every of the 46 nights on my last cruise. Sail away parties on Princess consisted of a Zumba Class!!!! Compared to a proper sail away party out of every port on my 2017 cruise. A copy of any medical treatment onboard to give ones doctor at home cost $120.00 They were given free on my last cruise. Many passengers thought as I did.

If you are in a wheel chair the ship is not too bad to get around. The sea princess is one of the older smaller ships that can fit through the  Panama Canal. its age is showing and the ship is overdue for  refit. the cabins are basic and tired as is the menu. however the wait staff are excellent as are the cabin stewards and the security personnel who go out of their way to assist those who are disabled. The destinations of the cruise include some real duds but do include some excellent stops. St Petersburgh, Curacao (Korasow) for example are great. Dubai, oman, aqaba are all interesting. others leave a lot to be desired. If you are in a wheelchair watch the boarding ramps on the ship, they can be steep and slippery. the door ways onto the decks can be a problem to get over and there is very little chance of using the deck pools unless you have some mobility. And the killer is there is no free ice cream on the pool deck like there used to be. I miss the choc and vanilla swirl. Now it is $6 a scoop.

It had a window, not a balcony, so we hid several suitcases behind the curtains - others went under the bed. This was a World Cruise which we began and ended in Auckland, NZ. Captain Lye told us we sailed through every temperature zone, every time zone, and almost every ocean on the planet. It was exceedingly interesting to go from hot and humid to hot and dry and then to cold and icy. Peru was almost more icy than Iceland - something I didn't expect! The ship is aging but her size is perfect. With 2000 passengers, she can go into most ports without tendering and the smaller ports are not overwhelmed with passengers seeking shore excursions. You can get to know your fellow passengers and relate to them much more easily than on a larger ship. The theater and Vista Lounge were at times filled to capacity when the more popular events were shown. Both Captains could feel at home among their passengers and take time to visit with them - unlike on the huge ships. The best feature of Sea Princess is that the Promenade Deck is usable.  You don't have to ascend to the top floor of the ship to go for a walk as you do on newer ships. Passengers are protected and not as exposed to the elements, though even the Promenade deck can be wet and windy. It is a feature much missed on the mammoth boats that are popular now. We had exciting ports to visit, though sadly we were not in condition to face the heat and sun of Aqaba, Jordan or undertake other vigorous shore excursions. The crew was fantastic - a shout out to head waiters Jose, Flaviu, Marcin, Arturo is in order. They did all they could to make sure the food service was excellent. Our room stewardess, Jaquelyn from Mexico, was amazing and kept the room neat and clean. An exceptional service was rendered by sanitation-housekeeping staff members during a sudden and drastic illness in the cabin. The medical team was pretty competent and understanding and recovery was complete in 48 hours. Shore excursions were generally very good but at times the port did not lend itself to easy tours so the team advised us which tour would be the easiest. This was the trip of a life time and the captains and crew made it very special for us.  Our cruise was from May 10 to August 25 - so 106 days, many at sea. One thing I found on this boat was that there were always books in the library. Our fellow passengers were generally friendly and open and a pleasure to be around.  We went to places like Komodo Island and Easter Island (though we were unable to tender there), New York City, Suez and Panama Canals, Pitcairn Island sail around and more.",Sail Date: July 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: |Destination: South Pacific|,"Georgetown, Texas"

Just don’t OK, the fact it has wash basins as you enter the food area + anti bac gel everywhere puts you on high alert, and the food is blahhh.Go outside to the bar near the pool they have those hot pies in cellophane bags - a far more pleasing option!!!!The boat also had an unpleasant old people home smell about it when we boarded - maybe the carpet shampoo??If you’ve booked anything onboard for some insane reason you have to re-confirm once onboard - I thought that got left with the Ark and American Airlines - needless to say our booked special breakfast on our balcony didn’t arrive.....Oh and if you like to dine with 12 other strangers every meal you’ll love it, but if you like peace and quiet by yourselves then you are strange like us and are frowned at. Oh and even when you cruise confirmation says ‘dinner confirmed for 7.45’ as we had booked for each night at a table for 2 - that means zip, and usually means a long wait whilst 4 waiters try to work out what to do.Food was OK but some barramundi served tasted ore like old flake.

The tours were varied and quite interesting. Tour operators were pleasant, full of information and answered questions readily. Our complaints include the over-service in our cabin (they wanted to make the bed twice a day and we wanted privacy during sea-days) and limited dinner options. Breakfast and lunch is a limited menu buffet style. The waiters will also take orders for over-easy eggs (sunny side up is what you get) with bacon or sausage and hash-browns (the same as at McDonald's). Dinner requires reservations in casual, formal or informal wear. One restaurant is available for dining without reservations but the dress code still stands. Each day on the ship's newsletter you're informed which. There is no buffet for dinner. We settled on eating dinner in our room. Room service was the best!The ship is small (600+) which allows guests to get to know each other. There is a large observation deck at the front of the ship for viewing the sounds, fjords, ocean, etc. The weather wasn't the best for swimming (December) but there is a pool and hot tub.

The overall experience was excellent, especially the ship and staff, but, the excursions and port locations (as they related to expectations) fell short on this excursions between Hong Kong and Singapore. For example, the bus rides were longer than the features and this was not only due to traffic which was tenuous, but, port locations far from the expected featured city. For example. Instead of the featured Bangkok we were at least 2.5 hours from anywhere in Bangkok and docked 40 minutes from lovely Pattaya. It seemed like every port we were either too big to get close (Hong Kong and far from Danang) or too small (Singapore). Thios left fro grueling bus and cab rides.

The cruise director was very apologetic and gave  us an on board credit of $100 and a refund. The food was exceptionally excellent and the booze flowed although the selection of wine could have been a notch or two better. Service was quick and polite.

We did Alaska--Anchorage to Vancouver on this cruise.Silver Muse was only about a year old.  We found the decor to be comparable to Silversea standards, but modernized. We prefer the older, warmer decor, but recognize that Silversea must keep up with the times.  Compare my pictures of Silver Muse with my pictures of Silver Shadow (we were on the final voyage of Silver Shadow before its makeover).As you probably know, Royal Caribbean bought Silversea a year ago. It may be starting to show.  1.	There have always been binoculars in Owner's Suites in the past.  Now eliminated.2.	Service in the restaurants on Silver Muse has deteriorated compared to our prior experience.  There were inordinately long waits between courses.  And it wasn't just us.  We had recommended Silversea to an informal group of 15, and everybody had similar experiences.  Our next to last night took the cake.  We were in one of their specialty restaurants (Silver Note).  Our reservation was for 8:00, and we arrived at that time. At 9:50, we had only been served an appetizer. We had waited an hour following our appetizer, and still had not been served our main course. That is when we walked out.  Perhaps, they have reduced the wait staff to the point that service does not meet their prior standards.  Or, perhaps, because of the expansion of the fleet, they have been forced to promote staff before they were ready.3.	They have installed Royal Caribbean's Cellular at Sea system on the Silversea cruise ships (I don’t recall that on my prior Silversea cruises).  Having spent my career in the wireless industry, let me assure you that there is no bigger rip-off than Cellular at Sea. You can easily spend far more on Cellular at Sea, than the cost of your cruise.  We worried that despite blocking our phones from connecting to Cellular at Sea, that we would unintentionally unblock it, and incur thousands of dollars in charges (thousands of dollars is not hyperbolic).4.	Restaurant reservations have been impossibly frustrating for me on Silversea. At the beginning of this cruise it occurred to me that I should probably make reservations for our next cruise, even though it was still 50 days away.  Here is what I got:  11 not available, and 14 waitlisted. I was unable to make a single reservation--not one.  I advised my cruise consultant that for future bookings he must set his alarm clock for midnight on the day reservations open and call me so that I don't miss the window of opportunity.  (In fairness, our butler was able to make reservation for all the restaurants during our next cruise.)5.	Silversea is remodeling their owner's suites and eliminating the convenient U-shaped bars.  They are putting in little cabinets that simply are not as nice or convenient for me.  While there were some disappointments with restaurant service, I trust that management will focus on correcting those deficits.",Sail Date: September 2019|Cabin Type: Suite|Type of Trip: |Destination: Alaska|,"Atlanta, Georgia"

The best was show was Japanese group who visited one evening. It is a pity because there are some very talented, young singers and entertainers with fantastic voices who appear to be having to perform in (again) dated presentations. The entertainment directors don't seem to be aware of what the clients would like. In this respect the enetrtainment provided was dire.On the same lines the dress code on the ship is ridiculous in this day and age. On 'Informal"" evenings men are still required to wear jackets in public areas and restaurants. If you forget your jacket restaurant managers will give one to you and you just have to put it on the back of your chair.All well and good but in the meantime passengers are just doing their own thing (good for them - it is a holiday after all).Why can't you dress as you would like to as long as it is appropriate?

We're experienced cruisers on multiple cruise lines, but this was the first cruise for our accompanying two couples (family). They really loved it and didn't want to go home to reality. We were a bit disappointed that excursions are no longer included, and that ran up the cost significantly. But having most of the restaurants and all the beer, wine & cocktails included makes it better. That said, the excursions are quite good.The Veranda Suites are a bit smaller than their older ships, but still quite nice -- with separate tub and shower in each bathroom. Our Butler was outstanding; don't know where they find these guys or how they keep them.The breakfast and lunch buffets in La Terraza were consistently superb. Great selection, variety, and no lines (thanks to the way they have arranged the various ""stations"").For dinner, we loved Indochine (Asian theme), and enjoyed Atlantide (main dining room with large continental menu) except for their miserably slow service. Menu changed at Indochine every 3-4 days and daily at Atlantide. We were not impressed with La Terrazza's Italian dinner menu. The pool Grill was unexciting for lunch, and became Hot Rocks for dinner, where you cooked your own food on a 400 degree slab of stone. Interesting and different, but once was enough. And if you ordered the salmon or shrimp, it literally wasn't enough -- not even enough food to feed a small woman. And Spaccanopoli (pizza) was good but not great; needed more topping on the freshly made dough.We weren't willing to pay $60 pp additional to dine at Le Dame (french) or Kaseiki (benihana show food), so can't comment. Our biggest complaint was the only true observation lounge was at the stern of the boat!?! But we were happy that there never seemed to be a crowd wherever we went on board -- except on disembarkation when Silversea did their usual poor job of moving people out of their cabins and off the ship in a timely manner.Overall this was a very enjoyable cruise, ship, and crew.

Our experiences on the Shadow were ok but not 6*. The ENTERTAINMENT was “basic” when compared to Crystal Cruises, Regent, and Cunard.  The Enrichment series on the Shadow was very good.  We had an excellent speaker that was able to cover the Regional history, cultures, religions, and more.  The Shore Excursions from the Shadow were very good. The Silversea excursion staff were also very good. Our next cruise was on the Muse. The ship was very nice but our overall onboard experiences were below expectations for Silversea!  Definitely not 6*… maybe 3* at 6* prices.On the Muse, the first Enrichment series was a number of slide shows from a photographer of his personal photos of his worldwide trips.  Since, this cruise was around Japan, we had fully expected Enrichment talks about Japanese culture, religions, history and maybe something about the Emperor’s abdication. NO! …just personal slide shows.  This “Enrichment series” would be awful for any cruise line to offer!  Again, we expected much more from Silversea. Regarding Entertainment, it again was “basic”.  The last night the “Silver Voices” performed a “Rock Rhapsody” with songs by Queen. That was the best entertainment show during our cruise. We continued on the Muse from Tokyo to Seward. The Enrichment series was better but not what we expected from Silversea. Seems that they hire speakers to to give talks that cover what they want to talk about and not related to the cruise itinerary.  Very disappointing!Entertainment on this second cruise on the Muse had a bit more variety but still was basic.  Also, most entertainment shows were repeats from the previous cruise. The last night was an improved repeat of Queen Songs. The Shore Excursions are not what I expected from Silversea. Disappointed!Continuing on the Muse from Seward to Vancouver.  The Enrichment series was very basic and was focused on whales, orcas and other sea life. Pretty basic presentations.  The entertainment was repeated again and supplemented with movies. Movies are ok, but should not be the replacement for live entertainment.  Not what I expected from Silversea!  (Also, the Queen Rock Rhapsody was performed, again).The Shore Excursions are not what I expected from Silversea. We realize that many of the ports are limited in scope but why not have Silversea “enhanced tours”?  And why stop in Haines & Wrangell, Alaska (populations of 1700 & 2500 respectively)?  Not much for two 1-day destination stops! Regarding food: on the Shadow the food and service were excellent!  On the Muse the food was ok but not great. Disappointed that menus were not changed more frequently then 1-week. The food service was ok but inconsistent... Often, meals were delivered very late after ordering, (or very early), out of sequence and too many times COLD and /or not cooked as requested.  And as one fellow passenger said… “I thought the food on Silversea was supposed to be great but really it is not very good” (expletives left out). Activities on board were also limited compared to our other cruises… seems that trivia and bingo were important events!On the positive side, our Silversea Butler service was excellent and has added to our overall experience. The Butlers provide a continuity of service that is extremely beneficial.As reference, my wife and I have experienced over 35 cruises during the last 19 years on various cruise lines. This is my 7th cruise on Silversea (over 100 days).  Based on our disappointing experience on the Muse, I am not planning another Silversea Cruise nor will I recommend the cruise line.

This extends to complimentary in-suite dining (if desired).The public spaces are spacious. The elegance is ""Italian""-inspired: marble-heavy, brown/beige colours  -  not of the light and fresh Scandinavian design you might find on Hapag-Lloyd vessels.A definite positive in my perception was the absence of piped music in public spaces.Announcements were kept to the minimum needed :-)Service is impeccable: never a push to sell and top shelf wines/liquor.  Competent and unobtrusive waiters. Plenty of complimentary wines sourced worldwide - you will definitely find would you prefer, and will find those bottles in any restaurant.Dining: other than for the super tender Filet Mignon, we did not find other cuts to our liking. However, there were plenty of alternatives.For lunch and breakfast we preferred the Terrazzo buffet lunch - delectable food morsels invite selective eating, with some variety introduced by local foodstuff bought during port calls.A special compliment for making generous amount of fresh fruit (berries etc) available for breakfast - even after several days at sea :-))The Keisei Japanese restaurant was great for light lunch meals (sashimi, sushi).The enrichment program was very good in our perception - destination lectures, magician, pianist, variety shows.Internet: complimentary 24/7 for any cabin level. Standard version is slow, yet functional. Permits VPN connections. High speed streaming option available for a price.The gym was of adequate size (I not that other reviewers felt the gym is too small - however, early in AM (7-8AM) we consistently found less than a handful of people using the gym - our favorite machinery was always available).Overall, Silver Sea delivers a classy performance - smooth and hard to match ...I just hope that w/ RCI now a majority owner of Silver this level of performance can be maintained.If you can find a repositioning cruise on Silver Seas, then such cruise can also be a good value for money.Thoroughly recommended!",Sail Date: June 2019|Cabin Type: Suite|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Alaska|,Timbuktu

This ship was freshly renovated.  We are not thrilled with the renovation.  The older ships have a U-Shaped wet bar that you can walk behind.  The Silver Muse eliminates the wet bar, and they put in a dry bar over by the window. You now have to use the powder room to get water.Owner's suites are the equivalent of three of the standard rooms.  It is much more comfortable to have a living and dining space in your room.  We always eat breakfast at our dining table.  It is just more convenient to eat breakfast in your robe.One good thing about the owner's suite is that your get included daily laundry service.  That way we can pack much lighter.  And just to give you perspective on how light we pack, I carry a backpack, and my wife carry's a roll aboard.  Two carry-ons is all that we take.  Nothing else.  No checked luggage.  That is true for a 7 day cruise or a 16 day cruise.Our trip got off to a bit of a rough start.  I will be frank, I expect my butler to make my dinner reservations.  I told him which restaurants we wanted to book.  I told him that we wanted to eat at 7:30 pm.  A short time later, he saw me in the hall, and said, I have you in the Italian Restaurant at 9:00 pm.  So I asked, so where are we eating tonight, since we are not eating at the Italian Restaurant at 9:00 pm?  He was dumbfounded.  I called my adviser in Miami, and it all got straightened out.  But I resent them assigning me such an inexperienced butler.A cruise is the only way to see Norway.  The train system is spotty.  Driving would just be painful.  I have cruised Norway twice.  Once years ago on Crystal, and again this year.Overall, we are satisfied with Silverseas.  We have a trip to Alaska and a trip to the Mediterranean.

There were only two sea days. We wished there were more.  Our trip began in Ft. Lauderdale. where we ocer nighted at the Pelican Grand.  Embarkation on the Muse was a breeze, though it took our bags a while to get to our suite. We spent the first day at sea before calling at glorious ports in Barbados, Grand Turk, St. Barts, Bequia, St. John, St. Thomas, Antigua and Martinique.Unfortunately, though we had four shore excursions (all snorkel and kayak) booked, we had to cancel them all due to illness (I caught a very bad bug). Still, we did get off the ship at each stop and strolled around assessing the damage from last fall's hurricanes. It was noticeable, but mostly things are returning to normal throughout the Caribbean.One highlight on shore came on a Sunday in Antigua when we visited nearby St. John’s Cathedral, where we stood in the back of the church listening to a melodic choir that was so good it gave us chills. We also checked out duty-free port shops in St. Thomas and did window shopping and hit the beach in Gustavia, St. Barts.Like every Silversea ship, the food on the Muse was superb in all venues (there are seven).

We also made good use of thewell-stocked fitness center and spa. I love taking steam baths at sea and there is no charge to do on Silversea. Our Siver Suite was steps from an attractive bar where we had pre-dinner drinks every evening. We enjoyed musical performances and lectures in the theater on board Silver Muse.Highlights:The nightly shows as well as a Death by Chocolate Latin Dance party on deck that was well received. Another highlight was the Silver Note supper club, where a talented jazz singer and equally adept pianist performed while guests ate or sat at the bar. We did the latter and thoroughly enjoyed the show.Cook it  yourself dinners at Hot Rocks on deck,Some options for drinking include the pool bar on deck 10, Panorama Lounge on deck 9, Dolce Vita on deck 5, Enoteca on deck 4, the bar at Atlantide, Silver Note and the Connoisseurs Corner on deck 8, which caters to cigar and cigarette smokers.

Unfortunately, our first Cunard experience with Queen Mary 2 on Voyage M906A (Hong Kong to Singapore) in March 2019 would also be our last, because the entire trip was chaotic and quite low in quality.  Embarkation at Hong Kong Kai Tak Cruise Terminal was a joke, as guests had to wait for more than 4 hours just to check-in and get onto the ship, something we had never experienced with other cruise lines.  Queen Mary 2 is a huge ship with 13 decks.  It is clean and hygienic.  The rather spacious BU type cabin is equipped with a TV, hairdryer, fridge, desk, sofa, and a sheltered metal balcony.  The only problem is the extremely weak A/C system.  With regard to the dining on board, food quality is mediocre at best, and the limited Cunard drinks options are not at all value for money!  Imagine white wine being served on the rocks at the welcoming cocktail party – well, guess things can’t get much worse?!  The cruise package includes daily complimentary sit-down meals at the Britannia Restaurant (Deck 2), which is the more formal and comfortable option.  Servers are mostly friendly and efficient.  One can also choose to enjoy the meals in buffet style at the more casual Kings Court (Deck 7), where there is a wider selection of food.  The best dish on the entire ship is probably the Beer Battered Atlantic Cod at the Golden Lion Pub.  On sea days, complimentary afternoon tea is served from 3:30 – 4:30pm at Queens Room, which is an utter disappointment due to its low quality and minimal resemblance to a proper English afternoon tea.  The Steakhouse at the Verandah is a specialty restaurant that serves lunch and dinner at an extra basic charge of USD 25/person and USD 39/person, respectively.  Some might argue it to be an experience, but honestly, it is not worth the extra USD 25 for a so-so burger lunch.  Onboard entertainment is another let down!  The casino is small with unwelcoming staff.  The slot machines are more complicated than fun.  With the exception of the superb performance by guest pianist Van-Anh Nguyen on the opening night, evening shows are poorly presented and not at all impressive - no wonder they are never full!  The worst part of the entire journey is Cunard’s poor arrangements on the tender service at the Nha Trang port and disembarkation at Singapore, causing unnecessary delays and chaos.  Before the trip, we were expecting it to be overwhelming with grandeur.  However, we left feeling completely underwhelmed and frustrated with the whole experience.",Sail Date: March 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Asia|,"Hong Kong, China"

It was simply terrific from beginning to end - from the complimentary champagne in our stateroom on arrival to my last fat boy breakfast to keep me going on the slow train from Southampton to Cardiff.We found our cabin very well equipped and spotlessly clean thanks to the full-time steward Joel who could not have been more helpful. If we left for a meal or to visit the gym he would have the room looking fresh when we returned. The public areas were very well kept - the odd glass left around by guests who should know better but nothing worse than that.The food was excellent - not just very good. The full meal service of 3 or 4 courses in the Brittania Restaurant was really first class. The waiters and sommeliers were spot on - skilled and attentive. The more relaxed Kings Court buffet was open at all hours and frankly, there was something to please everyone with lashings of fillet beef - smoked salmon and really anything you could think of. The cold tables were superb with a great choice of fish - meats and salads. My wife loved the daily watercolour classes which were well organised with good teachers. This was good for painting and very good for the social aspect as well. She disappeared from 10 to 12 each morning while I attended one or two of the high-quality lectures. These lectures were on subjects as diverse as Opera - the Brigthon Bombing - the Beatles and Martin Bell talking about his life as a war reporter.The evening entertainment was good and very varied. We particularly enjoyed the singers and dancers who put on 3 or 4 shows after dinner - they were very much better than we have seen on other holidays as they were all professionals.The gym came in very useful as we were enjoying the food and drinks too much - so we went each morning before breakfast and that set the day off well. It was well equipped with knowledgeable staff.We also paid  $420 to join the Canyon Ranch Spa which included a massive whirlpool / jacuzzi and steam and sauna rooms with a quiet cool relaxation area with complimentary refreshments.On the subject of refreshments, there was coffee and tea available 24/7 along with with good quality orange juice (a refreshing change from the awful stuff usually available) and cranberry and others. Iced water was also on tap.We were pleased and delighted to see how smart everyone was - especially for the 5 Gala evenings that were organised. These take place every 2 or 3 days and the dress is smart - very smart. The men wore black tie with a black or white dinner jacket while the women looked fabulous in long and short dresses.Now for a reality check. The drinks are actually rather expensive and all carry a 15% surcharge, so, for example, a glass of champagne and a martini could cost about $30. The cheapest bottle of wine is about $37.The shore excursions were fun and we visited St Thomas - Dominica - Barbados - St Kitts and St Maarten. Each of these meant going ashore after breakfast and either taking part in an organised tour by Cunard or doing one's own thing. We chose to be independent - not least because the tours were expensive. But frankly after a morning on a beach, or walking around the historic parts of the place we were more than ready to head back to the air-conditioned comfort and to enjoy a great cold buffet. The add on costs can mount up - the drinks package is $70 per person per day. So for a couple have to drink $140 worth of drinks a day - that is a real challenge. For our trip that would have added another £2000!Then the onboard wifi is costly. $300 would be the large package to cover our trip but I did not really need to be online that much so I chose a lower package of just 30 minutes to download a British newspaper daily.One thing that surprised us was the high number of people with mobility issues. We expected an older generation of course but the many scooters and zimmer frames amazed us. I can't begin to imagine what a speedy evacuation would look like.In this context, there were 5 or 6 emergency medical evacuations during the voyage which meant the invalid being airlifted by helicopter to a hospital or the ship returning to another port to offload the individual. We felt the Captain and crew handled these will skill and discretion and the other passengers hardly noticed.To summarise - we had a most enjoyable cruise. It was well worth the large expense and we would certainly go again and recommend it to others. Well done Cunard - the Captain and crew.",Sail Date: December 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Caribbean|,"Cardiff, United Kingdom"

Wouldn’t want this on any other cruise and wish I’d booked just a window cabin.  We were midships on 4th floor which is ideal for transatlantic.  However, the standard of food has deteriorated since the last time we sailed with her as also seemed to be the staff to passenger ratio, there were times when there were no plates, cups or glasses available in the buffet.  The room staff were excellent, we had Jake  and he kept our room spotless, towels changed etc.  The food in the restaurant was disappointing sometimes I couldn’t fancy any of the dishes offered.  We were late back into Southampton because of a couple of passenger evacuations and was unavoidable but what was avoidable was the chaos when it came to getting off the ship.  We were told if you wanted to get off as soon as the ship docked because of catching early flights etc to get a special card which would permit you to do that taking off your own luggage.  However, what maybe wasn’t anticipated was that practically everyone would be there trying to get off whether they had cards or luggage.  We were told we would dock at 12 but it was 12.30 which again was nobody’s fault and that we would probably be getting off at 1.15 which again didn’t happen as everyone was trying to get off.  There didn’t seem to be anyone in charge and we queued for ages in an orderly way but as soon as the doors opened and people were allowed off passengers were coming from everywhere and just joining the queue at the front.  It was particularly awful for us as our flight was at 3 o clock.  While the majority of these people were just going for “a look around Southampton” or going to the train station to get a train they hadn’t even booked yet. It was extremely stressful.  I told one of the entertainment staff who were responsible for this that we had a flight at 3 and they couldn’t give a hoot.

However the balcony seems to be rusting away and there are rust spots everywhere on the balcony, on other balconies and on many exposed areas of the ship.Additionally, the crew doesn't supervise cleaning in public areas so one can find discarded paper cups, napkins, and other detritus sitting in plain sight. The food in the main dining room was absolutely dreadful. They clearly are using cheap cuts of meat and poor quality vegetables. Unimaginative menus with poor table service and really poor quality overall. For instance the salads were offered with the same dressing for 12 nights straight and the lobster tail (which was really crayfish) was overcooked and even the waiter had trouble taking it out of the shell. He  had to return two to the kitchen and exchange them. Beef dishes were absolutely inedible. The excursion staff were nowhere to  be found on the  piers when we had day excursions, no transportation offered back to the ship courtesy of the cruise lines and every other cruise ship in port had transportation for their passengers. The luggage tags we were supposed to get were not delivered immediately and when they were, they were the wrong tags for the wrong departure time. Disembarkation at the end of the trip was poorly handled and once again one couldn't find anyone in charge who knew what was going on. The television had no closed captioning (not provided at all) and misinformation was printed about some of the daily activities. This cruise was a holiday cruise and the price had a premium attached. So not worth the premium and after 40 plus cruises on many cruiselines, including 5 on the QM2 we would seriously reconsider ever sailing on Cunard again. The Queen has lost her crown. If you  have any special needs at all or are interested at all in fine dining, this is definitely not the ship for you. Carelessness  and mediocrity could best describe the service.

However, the pencil did have a point. . . and the purser gave me a pen when I made the request, in person.   But this faux pas caused me to wonder where else they were cutting corners.   For smokers, this is the ship to avoid as they banish you to an upper deck with absolutely no shelter from the wind and rain.                              And I truly missed the flags and baked Alaska gala event that I remember from previous voyages.

While the stateroom is lovely...I missed waking up with the sunlight.  The service was first rate and it was a treat to dress for dinner and check in with table mates each evening.  Loved sailing from London with a largely British clientele.

First, the ship. Queen Mary 2 is not a cruise ship. She is an Ocean Liner. What does that mean? It means she is built differently than cruise ships. She is longer for her width, her freeboard (the distance from the waterline to the lowest deck where water can enter the ship) is much higher, her hull thicker and her top speed is considerably higher than a cruise ship. In fact, one thing she is well known for is being able to handle rough seas very well. On the inside, I would describe her as being elegant in her décor and passengers have a lot of elbow room as her square feet per guest is one of the highest out there. Also noteworthy is how the ship’s interior is drenched in history and tradition. In some places it feels a little like a museum with informative wall coverings speaking of the history of Cunard Line, earned trophies and honors and even artwork everywhere telling the story of ships and the sea. Places like the Main Lobby and the Britannia Restaurant are huge and grand but still very tasteful. With that said, sometimes she does feel a bit compartmentalized. This is an after effect of her being built strongly as a seagoing ship, so engineering considerations came first. Second, the service from the staff is uniformly outstanding. They know their jobs, do them very well and their attitude is one of pride in their work and in their ship. They are also extremely approachable and friendly. It is not uncommon for staff to know the passengers and vice versa – this sort of ongoing friendliness is part of Cunard culture. Third, the food. To me it is very well prepared across the board. The selection does not always conform 100% to my tastes but it is very well made with quality ingredients. I especially enjoyed the Steak Diane in the Britannia, the Fish and Chips in the Golden Lion pub and in the Verandah steakhouse the Filet Mignon was excellent. Which brings me to a place named Sir Samuels and the Godiva chocolate everywhere. The hot cocoa there is decadent to say the least. Overall, to me the experience was simply wonderful. I HIGHLY recommend Queen Mary 2 with this qualification – you have to go into it understanding what she is and what Cunard is. Cunard is all about elegance and ambiance, about being steeped in history and tradition and yes, it is the line for ship buffs. It is not the line with on deck rave parties and ziplines in the middle of the ships. So if you are attracted to the aspects I mentioned then Cunard may be the fit for you.",Sail Date: December 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Europe|,

We were offered a cheap blower that produced a smell of burning plastic, so we decided to forego this potentially dangerous option and slept in our sweaters and coats.

On driving to the terminal we were met by lovely staff directing and pleasantly have conversations. We drove and were directed to park and leave our car. Staff swiftly help you with your cases. Delivered our car keys and then directed to the inside terminal. Up the escalator and your are swiftly checked in. You are given a colour coded card, this allows groups to board in an orderly manner. We were waiting for 40 mins with other cruisers. A little cafe selling wines, champagne, snacks and beers. The boarding times arrives and your card is called. Quickly through security and you are on board. And WOW!!! its plush, magnificent, and oh so wow factor. The staff are so welcoming and helpful.We had already logged our credit card and passports (cashless all around the ship) . We knew what cabin we were and staff directed us. We were in cabin 11023. Oh my goodness it was utterly amazing. Initially we were inside cabin but at the last minute had a call from Cunard and we upgraded to Balcony. We were so pleased. On opening the door there was sparkling wine on chill with a personal welcome message. Our room attendant was Nancy and kept the room sparkling, even though we never met her. Wine poured and straight onto the balcony. We were so pleased we upgraded.We decided to get our bearings and see what was on board. There was plenty of places to eat and drink!!!! Endless we lost count and couldn't remember where the last one we found.!!! We stopped for a glass of wine and were astonished at the prices. £14 each for a large wine!!!! then on top service charge wether you wanted to pay it or not its added to everything on board.We met at the sail away party and the atmosphere was tremendous. Plenty of staff serving canapés and drinks and champagne station was plentiful. Again £36 for two champagnes. However this was our choice to drink and pay. You still have to pay for tea, coffee, juices and water. Again with service. There were busy bars and quiet areas for peace and again plenty of staff.Back to the room and getting ready for the evening, Shower really nice and hot nice big towels and good quality. The bed was wonderfully comfy and crisp white linen.Tea, coffee, milk and kettle if we needed it.Only the two fo us so room nice space. you do have a place for clothes plenty of hangers and storage and drawers. You do need to clear up behind you so space is plenty!First night we dined in the Varrandah its amazing and service wonderful. So pleased from beginning of meal to the end. Courses plenty to choose from and plentiful and service again wonderful. We pre-booked and paid for this before coming on the ship.We slept comfy and warm. To wake up onto the balcony was lovely, however NO dressing gowns or slippers??We breakfast at Kings WhaWe went into Bruges via a taxi on our own.100 Euros return journey, you are quite far out from the Bruges centre. Its such a pretty town centre. Walking shoes advisable plenty to see and do. We visited the Basilica WOW WOW WOW amazingly beautiful. We walked and walked and plenty to see the shops are wonderful and well priced. Plenty of coffee shops we had a coffee and croissant 5 Euros. There is a boat ride lasts about 30 mins (saved that for next time) 10 Euros.The Belgium Beers must be sampled we didn't find one we didn't like. The beer wall a good shout, Coconut beer is wonderful. lol and other places can't remember their names, you won't be disappointed. At the beer museum start with the beer flight of 5 for 10 Euros samples plenty big enough to share. And all reasonably priced. Taxi back to the ship and onto he 5 minute shuttle.Final evening we dined on Britannia Rest, amazing and cannot recommend enough. Two sittings we chose the late sitting and then ventured a walk around and quiet drink in other venues. The plantarium is wonderful, there are shows and films also if you chose not go straight to your room. There is plenty going on for all ages and abilities.  Couple of negatives, shops didn't seem to open during the day, only evenings. The cost of drinking amazingly high!!!!  You cant buy a drinks package on board for 2 or 3 days cruises.The Ypes memorial cemetery was cancelled days before we left due to lack of numbers. We had a special wreath made but wasted which was so sad and should not happen.

Our luggage was  transported from the car by Cunard staff for delivery to the cabin.   Very shortly after it arrived we noticed that the large hard backed case had suffered damage to one corner, causing a hole of approx 4"" diameter to appear, and a further small cut in the smaller hard backed case.  It was quite obvious that the damage had been caused by a fall from an appreciable height off the transporting trolley.Even before opening the case I reported this to the butler serving our cabin who said he would fill in a report, and eventually it was taken away to be temporally patched up.   What the staff failed to discover was that the lid had also been twisted out of line and that both locks could not be operated at the same time, thus leaving one end of the ajar.  In order to get the case home a member of staff assisted in trying to close the case but ended up in jamming the lock and upon arrival home the service of a locksmith was required to prize open the lid for us to unpack, thus rendering the case doubly unuseable.Having had no word from the staff, just prior to disembarkation I approached the concierge who asked me to complete a claim form and stated that it would be dealt with by the shore staff at Southampton.It is now November, and despite requests for  a progress report we have received no response whatsoever from the shore staff, who appear to be working on the assumption that  if ignored it would go away !!  It would seem that once you have spent your money on board and the ship has immediately docked you become ""yesterdays news"".The Cunard ships are lovely, but the action, or rather  inaction, of the customer relations team leaves much to be desired and does nothing to enhance the reputation of this much highly regarded Company.The financial consequence of this issue is relatively small in overall terms and does not in itself duly bother me, but it would have been nice to receive an acknowledgement and an apology at the very least.!!Eric Boardman",Sail Date: May 2019|Cabin Type: Suite|Type of Trip: |Destination: Europe|,"Lytham St Anne's, United Kingdom"

The layout of the ship doesn’t work as well as (say) the Queen Victoria - common areas feel smaller and less luxurious (think smart ferry), apparently because “it’s a liner, not a cruise ship”. Fair enough, the room was certainly good enough to spend all day in. The biggest disappointment, however, was the dining experience. Surly and disinterested staff, (bordering on downright rude in a few cases), and poor quality food (breakfast excepted).

She told me exactly what I already knew, and when I said I would like a followup, she told me, with no warmth at all, that no one else from Cunard would be contacting me.  She was rude.

This trip was a short trip, 9 days from Brooklyn to Hamburg.  The food was never better than average and sometimes it was downright awful.  The head chef apparently believes all things are better with salt.  I love salt but the food was so salty that I had to order ahead so that I could have less salt, and frankly, even those low salt meals had plenty.  The service was highly variable.  Some of the staff clearly appeared to be downright depressed.  Eye contact was rarely made and staff often raced to get ahead of you through the narrow hallways.  We had to be very careful because it was not unusual for a person with a big armload of plates or glassware to come tearing around a corner with no thought that a passenger could be coming from the opposite direction.  One day the hot water turned my face cloth YELLOW.  Over and over again, it did that.  I wondered about the ship's water quality after that. Cunard charges you for almost everything--we knew that going in--but it has gotten ridiculous.  The house red was undrinkable, when we pointed out that it appeared to oxidized, the sommelier offered to show us the bottle.  I am not sure why he thought that would be useful, he argued that the wine was fine.  There was no recycling that we could see.  The trash containers in the room were not split as on many ships today.  Clean coffee cups had brown rings that appeared as soon as the coffee was poured in them.  To Cunard's credit, the buffet was excellent, the dining room relatively quiet and the sushi was outstanding! But that is about all that was excellent.  The washing machines had lots of mold in the gaskets, never a good thing.  It was my understanding that there had been a recent refit, but our room was tired.  The sink was badly chipped.  The balcony door had a gasket that regularly detached.  We had only a single port of call, Southampton and it is important to note that while Cunard will happily sell you a transfer to get to town, apparently there was a shuttle bus which I believe was free that they did not talk about.  Also if you are going on a Cunard ship, you might want to know that the only time you are not charged for specialty coffee is if you order it in the dining room at lunch or dinner. Possibly at breakfast but I am not sure of that.  It is a little benefit that again, Cunard, does not publicize at all.  There are FEW clocks, the only clock in the room is on the phone which is nowhere near the bed.  There are a couple on the promenade deck and I saw one on one floor near one elevator.  Most ships do not keep the time a secret and I found this frustrating as we had events at certain times we wanted to attend.  In 9 days, there were 4 formal nights, which is a LOT.  All in all, I am unlikely to ever cruise on Cunard again.  As a very experienced cruiser, I found the Queen Mary absurdly overpriced and certainly not worth the price in any way.  The other Cunard cruises I have been on were far better, Cunard is deteriorating, in my opinion.  We should have flown business class instead of using a ship to cross the pond.  Our 9 days was a waste of $5000.  Cunard needs a lesson from Seabourn, which is not much more expensive and sometimes less, depending on when you book.  Tips, water and drinks are included!

Entire cruise and flight through Cunard.Their ticket allowed only one 23Kg case per person and for a 19 day cruise with 9 formal nights, this is not fit for purpose.We were more than happy to pay for extra luggage but Cunard had booked a ticket with BA which did not allow extra luggage to be purchase. How ridiculous and what appalling service.. Please enjoy our complaint below. We await their reply.Hello Complaints Department. We need urgent action please. We booked and have paid for this cruise including the BA flight from Heathrow to JFK. I called this morning to request additional luggage which I expect to pay for of course.This is a 19 Day cruise with 9 formal nights and one piece of luggage per person is grossly inadequate. My wife will have at least three ball gowns for example. I was told that the ticket booked by Cunard only allows for one 23KG case per person and I therefore requested an additional two cases for my wife, three in all, and an additional one case for myself, two in all. I was told by your assistant when I called at 10 am this morning, 25th October, that it was not possible to do this because of British Airway rules. (We are not stupid. It is only the BA rules for this group booking ticket and not the Airline rules at all, and we phoned BA to check.)I suggested that it was surely unreasonable to expect us to only have one 23Kg case each given the 19day cruise and 9 formal nights. Hardly fit for purpose. When I insisted in speaking to Complaints department, I was told that you take 28 days to respond and have no telephone extension. Eventually, I was put through to a lady called Abby, a supervisor. Abby explained that it was not Cunard but the Airlines rules. I replied that the issue is the ticket booked, a group booking I assume, and not the Airline and does she really think that one case for my wife is adequate given the 19 days cruise and 9 formal evenings. Essentially, she said that’s the rules and not Cunard’s problem She then checked online and said that I could take the extra luggage to the airport on check-in and pay then; but she could not confirm the certainty of this. She offered to see what BA says and come back to me by phone. I asked for email confirmation and she refused saying that Cunard cannot confirm in writing. Again, I asked to be put through to Complaints and she refused to do this. I still await her call back but please can you kindly deal with this urgently. 1.        Do Cunard really think that a limit, unchangeable, of one case is adequate? Is this fit for purpose given that your attraction is the more formal end of the Cruise spectrum with ballgowns etc. 2.        Given your reputation , as you like to promote, of being an experienced fly drive cruise line, do you think that this kind of inflexible approach to cruise luggage is satisfactory? 3.        Do you think it reasonable that your flight department were unwilling to book extra luggage for us, which we are happy to pay for? 4.        Abby spoke again to your unhelpful flight people who said they could cancel the booking and rebook a new ticket with a more suitable and fit for purpose flexible luggage allowance. We would have to pay for the cancellation. Is this reasonable that we should be required to pay for the cancellation given the unfit for purpose luggage allowance chosen by Cunard? Please confirm URGENTLY what you are going to do to resolve this please. As Diamond passengers with Cunard and shareholders of Carnival, this inflexibility, the unfit for purpose ticket booking, and unwillingness to transfer us to Complaints department leaves us feeling very, very dissatisfied. and we wonder whether you are indeed a capable Fly Cruise organisation.

Eating in the main dining room was ok sometimes, but there was always the option of informal dining at the Kings Court buffet.

What a fantastic experience!  We have been easily on 25 cruises-Princess, Celebrity, Royal Caribbean, Holland America, Norwegian, Carnival. This ship is far and away in a class by itself. First of all, being on a ship without seeing land for a week is not claustrophobic. There is so much to do that you do not have enough hours in the day!  There are different guest lecturers every week, at least 4 lectures a day. We saw an astronaut, an Academy award winning director and his wife who is an academy award winning costume designer. We saw BBC reporters and Newscasters who reported on the death of a Princess. We saw a coroner who discussed Jack the Ripper, a music lecturer who not only told us a great deal about the Gershwins, , Johnny Mercer and Frank Sinatra, but he also played the ukulele and encouraged us to sing along! An undersea archeologist. Astrophysicists. A planetarium.   Amazing beautifully prepared food. Polite and helpful staff. Catholic Mass every day. Places to sit and read. Ever changing displays in the Art Gallery. Dancing every night. Warning, it may be the largest dance floor on the seas, but it gets really crowded. A 6 hour stop in Southampton before we turned around to go back to NYC allowed us to go to a fantastic mall (West Quay) which reminds us of how nice our malls here in the US used to be. If we hadn’t been to Stonehenge a few years ago, we definitely would have gone on that excursion. The ship is beautiful, some areas look dated, but not in a bad way. The lounge chairs on the deck are wood and look like they were placed there in the 1930’s.

On 27/08/19 I received a ""Cancellation Invoice"" from Cunard stating that payment hadn't been made. I quickly checked the booking and the balance should have been paid by the 19/08/19, 9 days ago. Within minutes I telephoned their office wanting to make the payment. I was told that I'd been sent 3 emails requesting payment and the booking was cancelled by them. I hadn't received any of the 3 emails and despite the fact that they could not prove that they had been received! As our cabin had been re-sold we could book a higher grade cabin for a higher price and that was their Customer Care answer.

Manners probably count more than money with most guests.  For men, a tux and bow ties always look good on formal occasions - but again, a little effort probably matters more than the money invested in your outfit.Our fellow dining guests helped add to the experience. I know not everybody likes to sit at a large table, but to me it really enhances the whole experience.The only downside was that the weather was overcast for most of the trip, but that's hardly Cunard's fault...and there's so many activities and talks planned, that you don't really notice that much anyway.

We wanted to compare costs.  It was cheaper for the non package trip, but would have been much cheaper except for the servers upgrading your orders.  We would order a Gin and tonic requesting Bombay and tonic from the fountain and the check would com with a more expensive gin and Fever tree tonic for an additional cost of $2.00 making the cost about $13.  We noticed this on the third day and started paying attention and requesting that they stop and give us what we ordered.  This would only work about half the time and only one time did they actually change the bill to the correct amount.  When we tried to not leave the gratuity they just re-added it.

I have to say, that since Cunard was taken over by Carnival Cruise Lines it hasn't been the same.I thought that the main areas of the ship are still well maintained.....but the cabins are slightly 'worn' looking now, and a little shabby.  There were a lot of marks on the carpet of my balcony stateroom.....and other areas which weren't quite as 'pristine' as they had been in the past.",Sail Date: July 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Family (multi-generational)|Destination: Europe|,

We sailed on 31/5/2019.  Although it was booked a long way in advance it soon came round. We booked this directly with Cunard and picked our stateroom 8109.  It is an obstructed view balcony cabin.  We chose early sitting for dinner and a table for 2.  Our trip consisted of 7 nights sailing Transatlantic to New York.  We then arranged independently our flights from New York to Montreal.  We stayed in Montreal for 3 nights for the F1 Grand Prix.  We then flew back to New York, had the evening in Manhattan and stayed at JFK airport.  We then took the 10.20am flight with AA back to Heathrow.  Arriving in London at 10.20pm.  We spent the night at Heathrow and travelled home the following day.  Thus we didn’t miss a nights sleep as you do when you fly overnight from the US.We decided that we would hire a car one way from our home to Southampton.  We booked this through Enterprise.  Once at Southampton Enterprise provided us with transport to the docks so this saved us requiring a taxi.Once at the docks our large cases were taken from us to be loaded onto the ship.  We proceeded to check in with just our small cases.  As I am a Diamond World Club member we were straight up to the check in desk without any waiting.  There was quite a queue otherwise.  Once we had checked in we went through security.  There was a little queue for this but it didn’t take too long.  Once through this we walked onto the ship.  As we have been on before it always feels like you are home!  There are always plenty of staff on hand to help you get to know your way around the ship.  We headed to our room to drop off our cases.  We then went straight back out to get some lunch.  We chose to eat in The Golden Lion pub.  Fish and Chips it was delicious.  We then went to check the dessert offering in Kings Court on deck 7.  Afterwards we went back to our stateroom and our luggage had arrived so we unpacked.  There was the lifeboat drill at 4.30pm.  Our Muster station was in Kings Court.  There is quite a bit of standing around so if you do need to sit down then if you go early then you will be able to get a seat.Our stateroom although it was an obstructed view it was at the end of the lifeboats so only half was obstructed.  The layout of the room means that whilst sitting on the sofa you look out at the sea as that part didn’t have a lifeboat.  You also have a glass fronted balcony so that you can see the sea whilst sitting down.  The balcony has 2 chairs and a small table.  In the bathrooms there is shampoo, shower gel, conditioner, body lotion, shower cap cotton wool and soap.  The showers are larger than on the Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth.Our room steward Loue kept our room spotless.  Every day we went to breakfast and he had cleaned and made it look perfect by the time we came back.  In the evenings he again tidied it up and did the turndown.We had 7 luxurious nights and thoroughly enjoyed it all.The food was lovely.  We had a table in the Britannia Restaurant.  We ate breakfast in the Britannia every day.  Each morning we shared a table and in the evening we had a table for 2.  We managed to get on the same table several mornings with the same people so this was good to see what they had been up to.I like my English bacon well done.  It is a bit of a struggle sometimes to get this as the American bacon is the streaky bacon and is crispy but the usual way that the English bacon is cooked is not crispy.  I did manage to get this a couple of mornings.  Also if you want thick toast this is available and it is hot and fresh.  It is a special order so we did end up with more than needed!  Breakfast is good and there is anything you can possibly need.  If there is something not on the menu if you ask they may be able to provide this.  I asked for a smoothie each morning and they got this for me.Lunchtime we either ate in the pub. This gets extremely busy as it is so good and popular.  The fish and chips were my favourite.  We had one lunch in the Britannia but most of the time the menu wasn’t to our taste.  We ate one lunch in Kings Court.  There is a large selection of foods there and you can choose exactly what you want.  There is a pizza and pasta section.  There is a roast each day that changes.  There is salad, sushi and sandwiches.  There is also a massive selection of desserts.  There is always one hot dessert and then several choices of cold ones.There was also a good selection of lactose and gluten free products.  Each day there was either a pizza, quiche or sandwich in the gluten free section.  There was also several dessert options.  Each day there was usually a gluten free cake along with the usual parfait type desserts.  I had a Red Velvet cake one day and a carrot cake the next.  Both were delicious.  The cheesecake was a bit disappointing as all they did was provide the top part with no biscuit base come on Cunard.Afternoon tea.  You could previously ask for gluten free scones and these would be provided and be freshly made.  This time when I asked they were a prepacked large scone.  It was not fresh and was not very good.  I am not sure why Cunard have decided to source these this way rather than use the talented skills of their chefs to provide delicious scones like they used to.Evening meal all but one night we ate in the Britannia Restaurant.  We had a lovely table looking out at the ocean.  On one night there was a lovely sunset.  We also spotted some dolphins. Our waiters were fantastic.  The food was very good.  We never went hungry!  The Sommelier got to know our preferences and just said usual each night.On the night we didn’t eat in the Britannia we went to the specialty restaurant The Verandah.  We have never done this before as we didn’t feel the need to pay extra for a meal when the Britannia is so good.  As I am a Diamond World Club member I am entitled to complimentary lunch in The Verandah or if I preferred as we did the value of lunch towards the evening meal.  The food was amazing.  I would definitely recommend this is you are on the ship for any length of time.  I had the most amazing lamb and my partner had the braised short rib.  I found my dessert was a bit too rich so would choose the cheesecake next time!We enjoyed dressing each night for dinner.  The ship however, is kept at a very cold temperature so us ladies with our lovely ball gowns on do feel somewhat cold most of the time.  Especially in the theatre.  I would expect it to be cool in the Queens room for the ball and dancing but the other parts of the ship that are where you are just sat could do with being several degrees warmer so it is more comfortable.The lectures on the ship were not that much of interest to me but I did attend one and it was packed.  So that would just be that you may or may not get someone that you are interested in.  There was a film in the Illuminations each day.  Unfortunately the one film I really wanted to see clashed with the performance in the theatre.  The show times are 5.30pm, 8pm and 10.30pm.  The early clashed with dinner the middle one with the show and the late was too late.The entertainment was good.  We enjoyed Roy Locke who did 2 performances.  There was only one show with both the Cunard Singers and Dancers.  I think that was probably because they had just had a new batch on the ship and this was their first crossing.There is so much to do on the ship you don’t get bored.  We managed to walk round deck 7 each day 3 times to do our mile.  There was one day we couldn’t do this as the weather was too bad.The sea was calm, slight or moderate for the whole of the crossing.  Queen Mary 2 is the only ocean liner in service and handles the weather very well.The internet service although it does work in the staterooms it is much quicker in the public areas of the ship.

If this is the case you just click to purchase the amount you are entitled to and it is refunded to your account.On the last but one evening we had an announcement though our room from the captain.  He advised that there was a medical emergency onboard and we were diverting to Halifax.  They were hoping not to have to dock and just be able to tender using the lifeboat at 4am the following morning.  Unfortunately the weather was bad so this was not possible.  Instead we berthed at Halifax at about 6am for an hour.  We were then behind schedule.  The weather was also against us.  We had thick fog, driving rain and a head wind.  Because of this we were late into New York.  We were due to arrive at 6.30am but we didn’t arrive until 9am. As we were late we missed our slot for embarking the pilot for our journey into the Hudson so this delayed us as well.  The upside for a lot of people was that what is usually a very early arrival into to New York was a much later one so more people were on deck to enjoy this.I hope that the passenger who was ill has made a good recovery.  I did feel that the Pursers office could have been a bit more helpful to people who were going to miss their connections.  One passenger said they were travelling with an elderly relative and had booked wheelchair assistance off the ship and also at the airport.  They were going to miss their flight and all they were told was rebook then.Unfortunately for us we had an 11am flight to catch from La Guardia.  We had luck on our side though in the form of Kateryna one of the professional dancers.  She helped us tremendously and along with a helpful customs official we made the flight.  Phew.I would recommend this crossing to anyone.",Sail Date: June 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: United States|,"Grantham, United Kingdom"

It is a very shame this was not the case for the rest of the ship.The changes to the layout of the ship has meant less pool space, a huge Spa run by arrogant and rude management, I do not include the staff in this, a huge buffet ,for Grills guests a constant view whilst dining of sweaty bodies passing their windows and generally over crowding on the ship.We booked two spa sessions which were of a good standard and at the end asked if we would like to book further sessions, we were given a list of available times and told to return or phone to confirm, we were then automatically charged for them all although we had not agreed or indeed taken them.I have seen better entertainment in our local village hall, over 35 nights only 4 full cast shows, a multi national audience subjected to unsuitable British comedians, musicians using an advertised set as a rehearsal slot, the Jazz trio playing the same set every night so repetitive you could set your watch by it and a selection of so called guest entertainers who according to the Entertainments Director all seemed to be "" Direct from the West End"" , West End of where? I am not sure, but very few of which had any stage presence and were indeed second class acts. There was the exception to be fair but for this kind of experience this should be the majority. I really do question who is booking them?On a themed Evening of "" Night of the Raj"" we transported an wore costumes totally in keeping with the theme, we ate in the restaurant, went to the Royal court, had a drink in the Queens room, but were told to leave the Chart room as we were not in Black tie!!.The QM2 and Cunard used to be a brand linked to quality and outstanding service, not any more, the senior management on board were conspicuously absent with the exception of Captain Wells who seems to be doing the job of the Cruise Director as well.

We sailed from Southampton to New York after being on our own pre cruise for a couple of weeks in Europe. For years we dreamed of cruising on Cunard......I came prepared but give me another blanket, hat, socks....Brrrrr. Weather isn't predictable but in this case- The Captain had a ""say"" in our positioning and he left 2000+ passengers out in the cold [quite literally].I'll  preface this by saying we've been on dozens of cruises. Beginning years ago. The first was in a lower level stateroom with portholes [yes! There's such a thing. Princess. Deck 3. My better half, son, who was tiny and moi. We had Single beds and pullmans up top! Even with the budget stateroom it was one of the best trips ever. 14 days r/t San Francisco- Alaska- Gorgeous weather the entire way].....As we matured, and learned about cruising, our tastes refined, we upgraded ship choice, and staterooms. Our early cruises were family orientated - looking for ships with kids programs [Princess]  We always veered towards longer trips [at least 10 days and up to 28 days as the norm]. We did some amazing trips...Later, we began traveling with extended family and wanted more refined luxury [Holland America]. After a dozen trips, we decided smaller ships  were more to our liking, dressing up was fun.   Luxury is what we were looking for. [Seabourn, Crystal]. As opposed to a ""party"" atmosphere. We also wanted to visit some exotic / smaller ports where the larger ships couldn't get to. Often times this would require tendering. Worth it.After a number of trips we focused on Regent Seven Seas- and found our line. By this point in time, and a head full of colored over gray hair we had decided Regent was the ship line for us.  Smaller ships, immaculate stunning suites with ample balconies, all the perks of a 5 star hotel. . Extras were included, and even on longer voyages we were made to feel at home.  We didn't mind paying a premium to be treated very well while on holiday. We enjoyed the two nights pre at a nice hotel to reduce stress and like to travel business class air- especially when elderly parents were  joining us for multi generational holidays. In the back of our minds we knew there was one ship like no other, from the reviews we had heard, we waited for the opportune time to schedule it.The Queen Mary 2!We thought- a TransAtlantic crossing would be classic. We splurged on a fantastic suite. It was beautiful. It was approx 1200 square feet, and had a very nice balcony, which would have been outstanding to sit outside and enjoy- if only the Capt didn’t take a detour to Halifax. On this voyage it was just my husband and myself. Celebrating a milestone wedding anniversary.I commend Cunard for their pre cruise communication. We booked direct and they did a great job staying in contact with us. They also booked our air- even though we arrived to Europe two weeks ahead of the cruise. The [first class] fare was much less expensive [by two thirds].We had very nice table for two, and the maître d', sommelier, and entire staff were on point. If we had a complaint, it would be that basic items were not easily available. Some people eat much more simple than the menu options.  The buffets were very disappointing and don’t hold a candle to any of the cruise lines we’ve been on. Not in selection, quality or presentation. Regent and Seabourn lunch buffets make you feel as though you at an upscale gathering with fancy platters, bowls and premier displays. It is a pleasure to walk thru. A special note: I eat primarily fruit, veg and an assortment of salads. I enjoy my lifestyle. When I do indulge I want it to be something worthwhile. Thank you to Cunard for having the worlds best Scones. They were warm and delicious. Thoroughly amazing.The biggest complaint and I am sure Cunard received many calls about this because we heard many a grumble. There was a medical emergency during our trip. The Captain announced we were going to go 200 miles towards Canada and the Coast Guard would meet us. This would take us off course. Side note: our weather was just breaking.: And we would have had 3 nice days: The fog was burning off, the chill was coming off the air, and it was warming up enough to sit outside.  Almost every passenger watched the Cunard Channel in anticipation as the ship edged closer and closer to Halifax. Everyone was becoming annoyed. Over night the Captain pulled along side the dock [rather than rendezvousing out at sea] causing us to hit winter like conditions.  The entire next day was cold 40F, rainy, foggy, and in addition we were delayed arriving into the port of New York.  Customs/immigration was backed way up, and many people missing their connections. Our forward going plans [booked thru Cunard] were muddled and disorganized due to the  crowd scene.  Not a good way to continue on with the next leg of our journey.Glad we experienced Cunard. Happy to be home. We were very tired, and feel as though we need a vacation and didn’t get our money’s worth.",Sail Date: May 2019|Cabin Type: Suite|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Europe|,Arizona

A magnificent ship with a somewhat confusing layout in places! Spent 3 nights in New York beforehand so it was great to step on board for some R&R after the hustle and bustle of NY. There was a problem with boarding which was NOT Cunard fault (Port Authority had issues with internet etc). I personally felt unwell at check-in having stood in the queue for 1.5 hours and I had to move away from the area to recover. A Cunard hostess spotted me and came to my aid and stayed with me throughout embarkation. On board I was quickly direct to my Cabin which was delightful! Usual bottle of champers on ice that was very welcome! The ships new décor in 'interesting'! Not sure about the corridor carpets which, due to the colour combination from dark blue to grey, gave the appearance of the carpets actually being worn! If you have travelled on the Queen Elizabeth or Victoria you will be well used to the Commodore Lounge. The Queen Mary disappoints a little as it is much smaller. I personally found the seating particularly uncomfortable as they were so low that it was difficult to extract oneself from them! I saw a number of people having difficulty. The on-board entertainment was of a good standard. The 3D cinema and Planetarium was also fun. I went to see various guest speakers and they were all high quality. Golden Lion was my lunchtime haunt - love the chips! Great table in the Britannia 2nd sitting with a lively bunch of fellow travellers. Queens Room is lovely and also a nice quite place to site during the day if you wish to read, crochet, etc. Shops seemed to have a lot of offers this time as well. The Kings Court I found a little confusing but the Carinthia was, again, a lovely spot to site and watch the world go by. I spent quite a bit of time in the Chart Room and also Sir Samuel's (shhh!).

Boarding at Southampton was very slick though somewhat impersonal and the welcome on board was surprisingly absent. For us luggage took 4 hours to arrive in the cabin - there is a clear priority service in operation for frquent travellers!  The cabin was great - lots of room/storage space and attentive staff.  Dining was also good with Queens Grill able to provide excellent choices on and off the menu. Again it was clear that there was something of a pecking order in terms of where you were seated but it seemed to work out ok.  On board activity and entertainment was good and certainly satisfied most interests though I would have liked more of a focus on current affairs.  Disembarkation was a bit of a shambles mainly due to US Customs staffing issues but it also meant promised and paid for services for Cunard customers, eg, porterage were not delivered.  It took from 8.30 am to 3.30 pm to finally get to the hotel room in New York. The Hilton was ok but lacked a real restuarant. It is however well located. The final transfer to the airport was also a bit chaotic but finally worked and the BA flight back was fine. Overall it was an excellent trip but Cunard could improve on it not least by tighter control on its third party suppliers -after all their customers are paying after all.",Sail Date: June 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: United States|,"London, United Kingdom"

Boarding was superbly easy at Southampton and we were quickly boarded after filling out formalities in the Cruise centre.First port  of call was the Red Lion for lunch after which we went to find our cabin. Our luggage was already inside when we arrived. We quickly put it away and then headed out to explore this beautiful ship. Muster was probably the most disorganised muster I have ever attended and quite frankly knew very little from the actual experience. The ship is very big. Our cabin was on deck 12 near to the indoor swimming pool with sliding roof. Not that it slid back at all during the cruise it was quite fresh crossing the Atlantic. For 3 days we had quite rough weather. The ship handled it well but I did not. Avomine started to work within 20 minutes.The cabin was adequate for two people with a small bathroom and shower. Ample storage space. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept on. The cabin was kept immaculately clean by our always smiling and happy steward. The balcony was small but had two chairs and a small table on it.Restaurants.We were booked into the Club dining room at the rear of the Britannia restaurant. The food was excellent and there was plenty of choice. The Waiters were exceptional as was the Wine waiter. The Maitre'd irritated the life out of us reminding us every night that he had helped us with a window seat. If we go again we would definitely not go into that particular restaurant as he made us feel quite uncomfortable. The buffet at Kings Court appeared quite good and many people ate here instead of getting dressed up formally for the other restaurants. There appeared to be a good selection of food available each meal time and it was all self served. We only ate here once for a very late breakfast.The Queens ballroom holds an afternoon tea with a little string trio or a harpist who were excellent. The service was white gloved and the food was delicious. You have to do this at least once on the trip. We did have a champagne afternoon tea in the Champagne bar. It was very poor value for money and not as good as the Queens ballroom afternoon tea.Entertainment was of an excellent quality mostly. The big bands were superb however the male singer in the band was atrocious. Even the band raised an eyebrow at some of the things he sang. He may well have been a brilliant bandsman but singing was definitely not his forte. There was activities going on throughout the day even fencing if you so wished. You could do as much or as little as you wanted to. The enrichment lectures were superb although there was a malfunction of the film accompaniment with one of the lectures.The Six grand Balls over the two weeks on board were out of this world. It was a wonderful sight to see people pulling out all stops in dressing up. The masquerade ball was perhaps the most memorable.The bars and lounges were all very comfortable indeed and stocked a wide selection of alcohol. Despite it being rather chilly the pools and hot tubs were in use daily.There are so many facilities on board that it would be practically impossible to get bored when on the ship.Would I do it again?Yes in a heart beat.,Sail Date: May 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: United States|,"London, United Kingdom"

We had a balcony cabin on Deck 8, which was spacious, clean, and comfortable.  We used the gym and spa every day, and both were great.  Bars and restaurants are top notch, food is quite good (by cruising standards), and service is better than any other ship we’ve sailed.  In short, we’d take another voyage on the QM2.  But we were disappointed with our recent Southampton->NYC trip.  While I don’t blame the weather on Cunard, we had three days of very rough seas and high winds. The ship handled it well, but still rocked and rolled quite a bit.  That would have been ok if you could easily get some fresh air, but that was nearly impossible as Cunard basically shut down the main decks for nearly three days. We did figure out a way to sneak out, following some enterprising smokers. And of course, we could sit on our balcony.  But it felt like we were prisoners of Cunard, and left a poor taste. All the while, not a word of understanding by the captain, who would give his once-daily briefing, trying to be funny in that English sense (“oh, it’s just a fresh breeze...”), but it only came across as not caring. Then came the evening before the iconic sail into NYC.  It’s the biggest reason we wanted to be on this trip, to glide under the Verrazano Narrows Bridge and past the Statue of Liberty at sunrise. In his briefing the day before, the captain just casually mentions that, instead of sailing in at sunrise, we’d be sailing in at 3am - in full darkness.  Something about traffic and tides and again not really signaling his appreciation that he was depriving people of the experience they paid to see.  Ok, it is what it is, we thought.  We set our alarm clocks early, planning to be among the first people on the top deck to see us pass under the bridge at 3:30.   We got there, and the deck was CLOSED!  No explanation, just a rope.  We could see the bridge approaching, and there was more and more activity on the ship, so we decided to go to Deck 11, to at least get a good front view.  About 30-45 minutes later, we see people up on Deck 13, which the crew apparently opened up at some point. It was a major disappointed not to be on top deck for this, especially since we planned for it.  It was a major disappointment to sail into NYC in darkness, because you really don’t get the full Statue of Liberty experience.  But then it got almost absurd.  We pulled alongside in Brooklyn around 4:30am.  Our scheduled arrival was 6:30am.   There was no one there to receive the ship, so we just hovered there for TWO HOURS before they tied her up and started unloading our luggage.  I suppose some people went back to sleep, but we are up once we are up, so we were hoping to at least get a few extra hours in NYC out of this “early arrival.”  No such luck.  Disembarkation was to proceed exactly on the same schedule as if we had arrived at 6:30.  Back to being Cunard’s prisoners.  So, no experience and no benefit of early arrival.  A total dud. In sum, we like the ship a lot, and we’d consider another sail on her.  But we felt that Cunard (or perhaps just this senior staff) viewed this transatlantic crossing as very transactional, merely a way to get people from point A to point B on time and safely (which they did), rather than a once-in-a-lifetime experience (which they did not deliver).",Sail Date: May 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: United States|,

They did not order buses for a scheduled city tour and let the handlers outside advise that the tour was off and you would have to contact Cunard directly to get a refund. It was not the money it was the insult to over a 155 people that Edgar C. the shore excursion manager, had his staff lied to us for 3 hours and then stand and watch as people loaded into the buses without even reaching out to the clients and apologizing. It was something you would not expect even from the lowest of agencies, but for Cunard to do that I will ensure I never travel on their ship again and I hope people realize this is a testament to how they really think of their clients. This was a sad day for a company that professes high service. The thin vail was lifted and shown how unprofessional they really are, when it comes to treating people.

I took on 4/28 from England to NYC. Before I took chance I read 100+ reviews. Now I want to pay it forward.My wife and I took initially with reservations, as after 15 cruises, and being retired in Florida, we no longer enjoy dressing up on cruises. Also we did immediately after a 13 night repositioning cruise from Florida to England, and did not want to lug additional clothes for 2 cruises. We are very glad we took a chance, and encourage others to try.Our expectations were exceeded. Like other reviewers, with the same preferanceregarding dress, I would like to qualify my feedback. I knew from reading many reviews, that most QM2 travelers, preferred to dress to the hilt. I found about 75% of the travelers on my particular cruise fell into this category. I knew if I did not want to wear a tuxedo, or dark suit with tie, I could not dine after 6PM in the formal dining rooms. That was OK with me. Also knew that I probably could not attend the shows at night, but that was a trade-off I was OK making. Personally with about 25% of ship approximately preferring to dress casual at night, I think Cunard should bend a bit. Suggest they allocate a section, possibly balcony, to casual dressers, as a compromise. Also suggest they designate a small formal dining room or section, to those that would like to dress casually in the main dining room. That would give casual business casual dressers another option, but allow those that prefer formal to sit with those that prefer that option. We ate in the casual dining room and loved it. Our last few cruises were on Celebrity and the food on the QM2 casual dining room was superior to the Celebrity casual dining room, that was rather good. Some of my favorites in the casual DR were Rack of Lamb 2 nights, Rib Lamb Chops 2 nights, Sushi nightly, and Filet Mignon 1 night. Every night we say folks from the Main DR that opted for the casual DR because of the menu that night.Several days and nights,  we watched movies, that included Academy Award movies. Never felt out of place at the movies, dressed casually.Enjoyed the afternoon tea, with 3 woman from Ukraine playing violins. Actually followed their concerts all over the ship. Enjoyed the concert pianist playing in the theatre, before 6PM :)Some days wore shorts, other days long pants,  during day and night, throughout the ship.Found everyone on the ship extremely friendly although my dress was never better than business casual. Respected rights of those, to eat formally, in areas designated formal.Enjoyed the Winston Churchill Cigar Room very much, listening to classical music and watching the ocean.The Ocean Liner QM2 experience is unlike all the other cruises I have taken. Large percentage of British passengers, and ship seems very British. It looks differently than other cruise ships and handles the waves much better.We ate all our lunches in the Golden Lion Pub on the 2nd floor. Food is included with ticket, you just pay for drinks. Most days we were able to get small table right next to window. What an experience. We ate breakfasts and dinners in the casual dining areas. We enjoyed these areas, as they are really a bunch of spaces, rather than 1 room. Most days were were able to find tables in small alcoves overlooking the ocean.The QM2 accommodates casual dressed cruisers, but in my opinion, they could do more, without taking away anything from the experiences of those that prefer to dine dressed formally.However, to those of you, like my wife and I, that prefer not to dress formally, I encourage you to try the QM2. My wife and I both enjoyed so much, even with the limitations because we opted to dress business casual...that we will probably opt always to take the QM2 and or a repositioning cruise to from Europe. I took a chance on this cruise, because of the reviews on this site, by casually dressed cruisers. I encourage others to do the same.I also hope Cunard reads this type of reviews, and make additional changes to allow those of us onboard that prefer not to dress, to enjoy cruise even more. They can make these changes, in such a way, that respects the preferences of those that do not want to see any changes that effect them.We also enjoyed professional grade lectures, by a Canadian astronaut who lived in space over 6 months, terrorism related presentations and current event presentations by 2 ex BBC TV experts. Also by the way, just remembered to comment on the complimentary launderers onboard. On most floors, there  is a room with 3 washers and 3 dryers. I picked a room close to the laundry, for convenience. We were never bothered by the laundry down the hall. Actually it was quite nice, the convenience of being close, and being able to do a load of clothes, when machines were empty.",Sail Date: May 2019|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: United States|,

Cunard QM2 are the only ship that offers this facility.  Although it offers rather cramped surroundings on Kennel Deck, the Kennel Master and his assistant were the best.  Nothing was too much for them, they were funny, informative and hard working and clearly loved dogs. I spent most of my time with my dogs, which as it was a rough passage meant a great deal of time in a small lounge area with 20 other dogs as the outside was buffeted by winds and sprayed with sea.  A number of us experienced sea sickness, which for me was worse at the front of the ship, which meant I could not go to some places, but luckily the dogs were at the back, and dogs don't get sea sick (amazingly). In addition, my cabin was above some motor and shook and hummed all the time, which was pretty unpleasant.  I don't advise inside cabins on Deck 4.  I didn't see many events because they took place in Kennel visiting time and the dogs were kept in cages, rather than kennels and needed to be out as much as possible. Of course I would do it again, because my dogs cannot be put in hold on an airplane, but it was a bit like being on a giant restaurant for 7 days.

The rooms were comfortable; we had a king bed and a balcony with an unobstructed view. When the weather was good, we would go out and relax and watch the sea. We always put out the request to make up the room when we went to breakfast, and it was always done when we returned.Normal food was included in the fare; drinks and wine were extra. We ate in the Britannia restaurant, which had a wide range of food. Breakfast always offered the same wide range of choices. The menus for lunch and dinner varied throughout the voyage. We had an assigned table for dinner. At breakfast and lunch you requested a type of table from the head waiter. Twice we were offered real freshly prepared souffles at dinner and once escargots. Food is also available at a buffet throughout the day. In addition to these choices there are specialty bars and restaurants for a fee; we didn't feel the need to try them.When we left New York, we had a storm and very rough seas. Even that huge ship pitched a little and rolled some. The storm didn't affect any of the activities inside the ship, and I didn't hear of any cases of sea-sickness. We also had no trouble sleeping through the storm. Going outside was an adventure though.  The weather got much better later in the voyage; outside was cool but interesting-someone was even in the outdoor swimming pool. Summer would provide better weather, but we had our own timetable to meet. There were many activities throughout the ship all day. I was interested in some of the talks by experts and in the planetarium shows. My wife attended the knitting group for an hour each day. The ship's clocks were set ahead an hour every day at noon on this eastbound trip. I heard that the clocks were set back at midnight on a westbound voyage.If you have tagged your luggage, they will take it at the curb and deliver it to your room. Then they check your ticket. After that there was a long line to check your passport, take your picture etc. There were many clerks to try to board 2500 people quickly.

Lauderdale to Southampton on Celebrity’s Silhouette, then took Cunard’s QM II back to the States.  Taking longer trips is one of the perks of being retired! In each of the 6 times I've sailed with Cunard, there has been a problem with embarkation.  Cunard really needs to stop making excuses and get this simple job done right, every time.  As Platinum members we had priority boarding so it wasn't as bad for us as it was for others.Of the 43 cruises we’ve been on with various cruise lines, I’ve never been on a cruise that I didn’t absolutely love.  This cruise was no exception.  We had a great time.My taste is contemporary, so QM2’s old ship décor charm was somewhat lost on me.  We were in a “sheltered balcony cabin” # 5023.  Sheltered means the outside of balcony wall is not glass, but metal (although oddly, I couldn’t get a magnet to stick to it).  Often we take the extra savings provided with an inside cabin since we really only sleep and shower in the cabin.  However, we “splurged” this time since I do like the ceiling-to-floor, wall-to-wall daylight.  The cabin was inconveniently away at the front and normally we pick a more strategically located cabin when we pick inside.  Turned out we spent more time in the cabin than planned as the ship was very cold and we often dashed back to the cabin where we had the heat cranked up.On Celebrity Silhouette the towels were old and thin, so we felt like royalty with Cunard’s plush soft thick towels.  The food was good, but not as good as Celebrity’s.  For instance, my husband is a meat-and-potato guy so he’s so easy to please.  At lunch first day he looked for his usual ham and cheese sandwich only to be told it was way at the other end of the cafeteria.  When he got there they directed him back to where he’d started.  Now, uncharacteristically frustrated, he went back and demanded his simple request.  They told him he couldn’t get it today, but each day he could order one for the following day!  On ANY of the 43 cruises we’ve been on, there’s a deli-like sandwich bar where you can have any sandwich of your choice for lunch.  From there, as far as food was concerned, it was just all downhill for him.  As for me, I missed my daily salad for lunch.  Sure, there were salad offerings, but just not as many items to include in it as I’m used to (never grape tomatoes) and certainly there were never fresh berries of any kind, at any time.I’m a chocaholic and on one formal night, the cafeteria had 1” chocolate Cunard-logo logs with flavors inside to die for.  I’d go on the cruise again and again just for those little chocolates!Cruising transatlantic is different from Caribbean cruises in that Cunard emphasizes dressing up.  On the 7-day Atlantic crossing there are three formal nights, but actually every night is pretty much a formal affair (although the food doesn’t always reflect it).  There are more guest lectures and I enjoyed the short plays as slightly different entertainment.  There are more guest “competitions” (golf, hoops etc.) than other ships; Zumba is free and there’s a variety of ballroom dance classes as well as line dancing.  Cunard ships have a large ballroom which is unique, and even more unique is that it is actually used at night for ballroom dancing, complete with a half-dozen men who are paid to ask single women to dance.  The ballroom of course has many other uses during in day time. There's also a smaller disco club, but the music tends to suit the age of the passengers.  Think 60s to 80s.Celebrity arrived in Southampton one day, and the next day we sailed back to the States.  We've been to London several times and we'd both spent our first 20 years in Scotland so we weren't interested in visiting tour there.  Celebrity arrived at 5:30 am and we took the 8 am ferry to the Isle of Wight where we visited Osborne House (Queen Victoria's vacation home and where she eventually died) and Carisbrooke Castle where Charles the first was imprisoned before being beheaded.  Pretty island and worth the trip.  Fish and chips on the ferry on the return journey just hit the spot.  We spent the night at the Holiday Inn on Herbert walker Ave (highly recommend it) which is just outside the gate of the port where we docked so we walked straight there and next morning we walked to the nearby Titanic sites and around the Walls of old Southampton.  We still had time to shop at the shopping mall right down town and Cunard's ship was also within walking distance.  So we had two days and one night before sailing home.  A trip I would have like to have taken would be to Highclere (Downtown Abbey) but they have limited opening days.  With the ship arriving at 5:30 am you could take a train to London and enjoy the day there, but of course you would want to spend the night somewhere.With our Celebrity ship we could have taken a back-to-back to Norway (kicked myself when I realized this too late) and since Cunard's QM2 leaves Southampton (alternatively New York) every 2 weeks, we could have taken a later cruise back to the States.  Oh well, maybe another time.Yes, I’d say when I take another transatlantic cruise from (or back to the States) in Europe I’d travel to Southampton to take this ship back to the States rather than fly.The 2 week cruise on Celebrity was great, changing the clock only every other day.  On Cunard it was almost every day (shorter cruise) but far better than changing the clock 5 hours in one shot when flying.

This ship is elegant, and many cruisers would be put off by expectations that they might have little in common with other passengers.  That is not true at all as they turned out to be reasonable and intelligent people with no element of 'snobbery'.  Artworks and floral arrangements around the ship scream quality, not cheap tat like some other ships. Boarding swift and efficient, thanks to Ocean Terminal staff in Southampton.  We were on fixed dining in the Britannia Restaurant. I don't think the ship was full as there were quite a few spare seats on tables in the Britannia.  The Britannia staff were more than happy to help people relocate to other tables.   As people made friends, including us, that was great.  Nothing was too much trouble.   Food and service first evening were nothing special, and we found food in the Buffet style area the first and second lunchtimes poorly presented (although cheese was better in the Buffet than the Britannia - very strange).  We witnessed a meeting of chefs and waiters on deck, during which they were addressed in military and certainly unparliamentary language, and by that same evening food and service vastly improved.  We did not dine in any speciality restaurant, so cannot speak for them. We tended to lunch in the Britannia dining room which was very good.  Interestingly, we met no-one (Brits and others) who were in favor of leaving the EU.  This proves many things - that we don't know any idiots, and that the Kleine Englanders who voted Leave have probably never traveled beyond the end of their street!.  Politics aside, we had great conversations with intelligent, interesting. people.Lectures during the day were excellent, from such luminaries as Capt David Henderson, ex RAF and BA pilot regaling us with the inside track on air travel, and sharing his plausible theories about Malaysian flight MH370.  Sir Jackie Stewart was also first class.  Plenty of indoor games to play during stormy weather.  This is one of few cruise ships where you can walk right around the outside deck.   The library was also absolutely brilliant and so was the Planetarium.Evening entertainment excellent, from the Royal Court Theatre Company (with orchestra), Bryan Cheetham, whose singing/dancing was very good was perhaps trying too hard on the first evening (his extra effort complemented the lack of effort from the caterers and waiters the same evening).  Stand up comedian Mickey Zany was a bit of a curate's egg, good in parts, and most of his jokes should have been pensioned off years ago, or preferably put out of their obvious misery!The ship did not stink of cigarette smoke, surviving devotees of this filthy habit being confined to well defined and ventilated areas.  Also not excessive numbers of machines and tables in the Casino (another of my pet hates, can't you tell).As with all cruise ships, on board drinks are expensive, but bringing your own modest supply on board, for consumption in your cabin, is at least tolerated.  At least on this ship, passengers are not treated as cash cows, to be held up by the ankles and shaken down at regular intervals.Make sure you bring something nice to wear, but can probably leave the top hat and tails behind (unless you are the late great Fred Astaire!).  Do expect to be politely asked to go and get changed if you don't meet the reasonable dress standards in all the restaurants other than the Buffet.This ship can be summarised as 'Sublime' - just wait for my review on the Norwegian Getaway, best summed up as 'Ridiculous'. I will write that review when I have refilled my pen with a suitable supply of venom.The long and the short of this is we ""love"" the Queen Mary and will be travelling on her again.

To arrive in Britain after seven days at sea was a real treat. No jet lag, and for seniors skipping 2-3 days of Zombihood is priceless. Plus the varied entertainment, lectures( both entertaining and educational), music venues, and social activities were myriad. In fact, we did not have time to do all the things we would have liked.

The entire trip, including First Class Singapore Air and Queens Grill/Penthouse with Cunard was in excess of $70k, so I expected stellar service. In brief, the QM2 is tired.  Very tired.  I am not just talking about rust, unpainted surfaces, and worn out carpets; more importantly, I am talking about service.  In past cruises, the majority of the wait staff and non crew members seemed to come from Eastern European countries - Romania, Poland, Bulgaria, the Baltic states, etc.  English was their second language, but they were able to be understood.  It seemed that the bulk of the wait staff and non-crew on this latest voyage hailed from the Far East and India.  Those that attempted to speak English were very difficult to communicate with; many just stared blankly when asked a question.   If I had to identify the number one “need” on the QM2 I would answer “training.”   There seems to be a lack of training in almost every service offered.  When going ashore on excursions, there are two card readers; one to register those going ashore and one for those returning.  On several occasions, only one reader would be in service, which would cause ‘logjams” at the gangway.  After mentioning that “if both readers would be turned on, the flow would increase,’ the crew member would make a call, another crew member would show up and both readers would be turned on. Point being, it was just  common sense.  The port call at Chennai, India, (a first for the QM2), was a complete mashup.  The crew was unable to provide the landing cards in time, there was misunderstandings about visas, long lines at the immigration desk on board and delayed departing times.  Partly to blame was the Indian bureaucracy, but the inefficiency of the crew also had to be held to fault.  Peeling paint, rust evident In very conspicuous and public places, and threadbare carpeting in many hallways was depressing.  More depressing was that during the entire voyage(s), we seldom saw a maintenance person scraping, chipping, painting or repairing.  That is in stark contrast to former Cunard cruises where we constantly observed repairs taking place.  My wife and I were celebrating our 25th anniversary and had made several advance appointments for spa services.  During the first, a manicure for me and a massage for my wife, we both noted how far Canyon Ranch had fallen.  Dirty spa rooms, flaking and broken tile, broken spa equipment and inadequate service. Most irritating of all, the insistent marketing of every salve, cream, ointment and hair treatment from the time you show up for your appointment until you leave.  (My attendant bagged several items for me that I never requested and requested my signature for several hundred dollars.  I told her no thank you).  Needless to say, we canceled the remainder of our appointments, to avoid the badgering.  I could go on to mention inattentive waiters, a hopelessly out of date cabin entertainment system. (In this day and age to not have a call up onboard daily billing system and a selection of streaming movies through your cabin entertainment system, plus Bluetooth connectivity to view photos on your cabin TV is criminal  - I mentioned this to the Captain and he agreed. I also mentioned it to the Purser who replied, ""Well, we would rather have the personal face-to face contact with you,"" meaning I have to walk down 8 decks every time I question a bill), and a rather bland and repetitive variety of menus in the Queens grill, but my point remains, the QM2 and perhaps Cunard needs a makeover.    Once, when cruising Crystal, I was asked if the additional cost was worth it.  Having just completed a voyage on the QM2, for a lesser cost, I answer, “no, similar quality can be had for a lesser price.”  No longer true on the QM2.   The romance of an ocean liner vs a cruise ship is not enough to maintain customer loyalty.  Sadly, we will be booking future cruises on SilverSea.",Sail Date: April 2019|Cabin Type: Suite|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Middle East|,"Clover, South Carolina"

Yes the class system, based on wealth is alive and kicking on Cunard! .My room was perfectly adequate for my needs though, and the fixtures and fittings and cleanliness were excellent. The dining for us 'tourist class was still luxurious by most standards. The food was a bit pretentious, and you won't get fat on the portions in the Britannia Restaurant, but it was generally very good. Their beef especially was invariably excellent. I felt that they were a little conservative with FLAVOUR though- if you are going to offer a spicy alternative, make it spicy! I also felt they missed an opportunity to include local specialities from the places we visited; it was all 'International Cuisine' every night.I thought the wine was expensive; $40 plus tax for a bottle that would be £6 in a supermarket.Also I didn't feel the service was very friendly. Perhaps they were jaded at the end of their world tour, but they lacked something- being quite stand-offish. Most passengers chose to eat breakfast and lunch in the less formal 'Kings Court' buffet.There was certainly plenty of variety on offer at both meals; I think everyone could feed themselves well there.Again the quality was good, and no restrictions on quantity! Facilities on board include; a night club, a proper ballroom, 2 'pub-type' bars, a large theatre where the evening shows are generally very good, a lecture theatre that doubles as the Planetarium ( and this is where Cunard really scores; the 'Insight' and 'guest celebrity' speakers were all excellent), a 'Grand lobby' which actually isn't that 'grand- it is where the pursers office, the tour office, the future cruises office, and the photography service are based, with upstairs, the champagne bar, the Godiva chocolate coffee shop, and the shopping mall. Another good feature of Cunard is that they don't give you the hard sell. The selling technique is very civilised in approach; even from the 'Clarendon Art Gallery'.The shops sell duy free, perfumes, jewellery, clothes and souvenirs, but they really need a 'convenience shop with more prosaic things like ordinary toiletries and snacks.There is an IT room where they help connect you to the ship's wi-fi. $45 for 240 minutes. is that OK? There is a small 'children's zone' with their own pool though there seemed to be very few children on board. The vast majority are aged 60+.There are two further pools, one inside and one outside, but frankly, they are small.There are two very civilised lounges; The Carinthia, where they serve light breakfasts, and lunches, and the Commodore Club which is a forward facing bar. There is also the 'Verandah' dining room which opens onto the outside 'Terrace bar' on deck 8.There is a spa, beauty centre and gym. A library and bookshop. Deck 7 is the promenade deck. I seem to remember 3 circuits being a mile. Aft, there is deck space on deck 8 too.There is an observation deck on deck 11, below the bridge, and a 'Lookout on deck 13 above the bridge which leads onto an open area effectively deck 14 to catch the breeze, and leads down to the sun-deck midships. There are various deck games available there. Oh, and there is  the 'Churchill Lounge' for cigar smokers. Cigarette smokers not welcome. That's Cunard for you! 'Smart' dress for dinner is casual jacket and trousers, no tie required. 'Gala evening' dress is dinner jacket, and tie. For the ladies, it seemed that anything smart was acceptable, with sequins and sparkle an advantage. I travelled alone and was lucky to be allocated to a table of 8 solo travellers; we got on very well and often spent the evenings together. There are also coffee mornings and other activities for people on their own. There are art and craft classes, dancing tuition and numerous quizzes and game shows and other activities through the day. You won't get bored! And then there's the destinations! But they deserve their own reviews. Sorry it's been a bit long. Well done if you persevered!

The ship was perfect. We had been on her several times before, starting with our first ever cruise in 2006. Since the refit a couple of years ago she just sparkles. The Christmas decorations and celebrations were fabulous, with lots of activities for passengers to enjoy. The New Years Eve party night was great fun.On board spends are not cheap, so not a ship or indeed a cruise line for the budget conscious. We average about $100 per day which includes money spent on excursions, bar, wines, gifts and speciality coffees and cakes. Excursions can be very expensive for what you get, so just check out alternatives before you travel. For example on Barbados, we paid about $60  each for a beach trip which included a free drink with parasol and personal spot on the beach. On the way back to the ship we found we could have done the same for $25 for two from one of the local excursion companies. So just check things out first. Some trips like the catamaran party to the Pitons on St Lucia was an absolute blast - beware the rum punch - it sneaks up on you !, and well worth the money.Accommodation, staff, service, cleanliness, entertainments (of which there is a huge variety), activities and the food were 5* throughout our month on board - altogether a fabulous holiday. Just one note of caution for new travellers, the North Atlantic Ocean from November through March can be very rough and on this round trip you have seven days at the beginning and end of the voyage when you are at sea - there is no escape, so if you need them take your travel and sea sick medication with you.",Sail Date: December 2018|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Family (multi-generational)|Destination: Caribbean|,"Leicester, United Kingdom"

If it hadn't been for the wonderful fellow passengers I would have been really browned off with this trip.  My main complaint about the ship are the showers.  The oceanview and balcony cabins all have a shower over a bath with quite high sides.  Apparently the only walk-in showers are in the interior and disability cabins.  This is the only cruise ship that I've been on with this and I would never recommend it for older travellers or those less nimble.  I hate to think what it would have been like showering on a rough sea day!  The on-board shops were not well stocked and the duty free shop ran out of liquor.  On the plus side, the crew (with only one exception) were very friendly and helpful.  The meals were excellent - I can't comment on the buffet as I never went there but it was strange that there was no 24 hour availability as there is on many other ships.  Although a minor detail, the lack of table cloths in the Waterfront Restaurant and the Eurasia Waterfront Restaurant detracted somewhat from their style.  The shore excursions, in the main, were reasonably priced in comparison to other cruise lines and embarkation and debarkation were speedy and efficient.  Although, in general, the ship was quite good, I would not travel on it again because of those showers.It's worth remembering that this ship does not cater to children although they're welcome on board so really the swimming pool is probably their only attraction.  It's probably not a bad option if you're looking to cruise at a reasonably lower price than some other cruise lines but you get what you pay for.",Sail Date: January 2020|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: |Destination: Asia|,"Perth, Western Australia"

The cabin was well made up and cleaned daily.  The plumbing did fail a couple of times.    Fortunately it was fixed in record time.The food was good at the Bistro and the restaurants.    It was often difficult to find seating at the bistro which operates like a food hall.    The service in the restaurants was variable, from downright unfriendly to practically a floor show from three or four of the waiters doing intricate folding of table napkins with a hilarious commentary when there was hardly anyone in the restaurant.  Sometimes the wrong food appeared and once the final course did not appear at all.The entertainment was overall brilliant.    There was plenty going on all over the ship and the show at night - especially the ""Around the World"" show - was always entertaining.    There was a wonderful violinist who was accompanied by a pianist and they did a few sets every day.    A joy to hear.

The food was average at best in our opinion with a set menu for ten nights in the Mediterranean and Asian restaurants and a changing menu in the waterfront restaurant which basically serves to you what is available in the bistro. The Christmas dinner we enjoyed very much. The catering staff did their best and were generally very good. Plenty of activities on board with fab and fun crew with excellent dancers. A highlight for us was listening to the haunting classical tones of Savannah whilst basking around the pool on a lovey warm day. Many thanks to Juliana and arnopa for their warm and friendly cabin serviceThe beautiful Nevena from bar staff and Vijay from catering led the the way with the largest smiles and fantastic service. Unfortunately most of their colleagues did not follow suit. On board entertainment was very good our favourites being ‘the maestro’ Niko and the sublime Daniella brightening each evening. We have cruised with royal Caribbean before and found they were very much a step up from this but if you lower your expectations, go with the flow and concentrate on enjoying yourself you will find this liner represents pretty good value for money",Sail Date: December 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Australia|,"Hallett Cove, Australia"

The ship is 27 years old and looks it.  CMV claims it has been completely refurbished but it is not apparent.  There are sewage problems (toilets not working, bad smells in cabins and hallways) that have been documented for months by other travelers.  In addition, they found swarms of insects inside the wood in my cabin, and my toilet didn't flush at night.   I reported this, and a foul smell, each of the last 7 days of the cruises but it wasn't fixed.  Yuck!There was nothing to do on this ship.   All day the best they could do for ""entertainment"" were things like sewing classes and Bingo.  Although I sailed in mid-summer, the pools were drained and closed most days.Avoid buying Internet.  It is a scam!   I called twice before paying my balance and they assured me there was service in the cabins, but when I boarded they said there is not service in the cabins.  They ultimately sold me a $99 package with 1 gigabyte but it was used up in 48 hours (I was online about 2 of those hours).  Apparently your laptop drains the usage even when it is turned off????  I could not get a straight answer because their ""IT people"" did not speak much English.BTW - I don't speak another language and don't criticize any individual for not speaking English.   But don't hire them as crew for a ship based in Australia and serving a virtually 100% English speaking clientele.  The food was atrocious, and there is no buffet.   You have to ask servers who speak little to no English for your food, and what you get is awful.   Perhaps in deference to the demographic on the ship, they make everything bland, but most dishes were literally indistinguishable from another.  There were many times I skipped free meals because the food was so poor.The best thing on the ship was a very well equipped, large fitness centre.   Again, perhaps because of the demographics, I was in there alone several times and never saw more than 5 people in there at a time (and it looked like it could accommodate 40 without feeling crowded).  However, when I needed help with a machine there was no one to ask and the guy from the spa didn't know how the machines worked (and, of course, barely spoke English).Not only did many of the crew not speak English, but they were almost cartoonishly unfriendly.    I found myself saying ""you're welcome"" out loud to myself after dozens of ""thank yous"" went without a reply.I asked to depart the cruise at the first port but was told I would not get any partial refund.  I have filed complaints with the company and with the Office of Fair Trading.Please be smart (like I was not!) - and read the reviews.  I was shocked at how many previous passengers commented on the same things as me (sewage problems, unfriendly staff that didn't speak English, Internet problems, bad food).  I would advise NEVER to book with CMV (Cruise and Maritime Voyages) and certainly not on this ship.",Sail Date: December 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Australia|,"Queensland, Australia"

Here they serve warm, diluted fruit juice, toast that is dehydrated and as easy to cut as cardboard, warm tea, a single tiny strip of bacon with the scrambled eggs that is cut as thin as paper and most days a hot breakfast delivered warm. The cakes and afternoon tea scones are dry, tasteless and hard to explain because these are items every passenger makes so easily at home to a higher standard. The drinking water offered in the restaurant smells strongly of the poisonous chlorine. The entertainment was an overproduced show based on boring song choices. Excellent backing band. It reminded me of a school concert that was too busy and tried too hard. This same ensemble provided 3 nights of the same stuff under different themes. We didn't get any value from the shows because we left after 30 minutes. The final bill had gratuities added at $12 per passenger per day, so they tried to add $72 dollars to our trip without authorisation. That was removed when challenged. My wife and I have been on this ship 3 times so we could compare it with P&O's service and standards. The new owners can fix the problems I have noted to bring it up to scratch.

I travelled with my partner and 6y/o son. A lot of older folk and seasoned cruisers were true to form; not happy unless they have something to complain about. But I enjoyed it a lot more than our previous cruise in January on a much bigger ship. No pushy seagulls at the buffet , no cosplay furries or photographers hassling you and much, much nicer staff. The decor was lovely,  not gaudy ""faux vegas"".No queues for the restaurants or buffet.The drinks package proved a good investment, even tho the ship initially had no record of it and they were going to call head office- we booked through an agent- but I called my agent and was sorted within 12 hours. I mucked up boarding time and arrived 3 hours late and totally stressed out but everyone was so kind and  tolerant. Food was good if not a multitude of choices, and catered well for dietary requirements and allergies.No set dining times in restaurants was more our style. Not a raft of activities but enough for our 6/yo. We were onboard to relax, live musos in the bars and the shows were great. and real books in the library.Our stateroom was clean and tidy with a bath! The lifts were clean, public areas spotless, and lots of quiet areas to retreat to. The study was lovely.Our trip to Burnie was cancelled due to dangerous seas, so we popped in to Eden instead.Big swells rocked us to sleep. On the last morning, there was no power or water, and we were at a standstill, within view of Adelaide. Staff were obviously avoiding the passengers, then the Captain announced an alarm light had come on, and the engines and power disabled, until it was investigated.Reports that the ship was listing was exaggerated.  A cold continental breakfast was still available ( sans hot drinks and toast) but on the 11th deck, so folk with mobility issues would have been unable to partake due to lifts not working. It was just a shame the passengers were kept in the dark ( those on inside cabins quite literally) and those with flights and appointments in Adelaide were angered, but this is a risk with all modes of travel. and 3 hours on a cruise ship is preferable to 10 hours in an airport when flights are cancelled IMHO.Communication could have been better on this score, instead of the deliberate evasion of staff. Egress on and off the ship were quick and easy, and I found everyone helpful and friendly. Everyone was tolerant and made our son feel special.

I checked the reviews in internet and the ratings where very good, so I decided to go for it as the itinerary and amount of days were perfect for the celebration of our birthdays and anniversary on May 14, 18 and 25. We made reservations, and anytime that we had doubts about anything, our agency would go and check with Cruise n Maritime offices in USA, which could never give an answer without checking with their headquarters. Seems to me that they had not been totally trained… but that is ok with me, as maybe they did not have enough time. We got into the REMODELED SHIP on a rainy afternoon. What a surprise I had when entering the ship and seeing water coming inside the public areas and being collected in buckets all around those areas. Fans had to be working for several days before everything was dry.The public areas were indeed beautifully remodeled.The exception to the above was that all the panoramic windows in the public areas like floor 7, 8 and 11, that were and are very dirty. Those windows had never been properly cleaned, I guess for a very long time, and not even the rain can help with that issue. And also, all around the ship there are many areas that show the rust.My cabin 9147, cat. 14, was remodeled ok, nothing great, but there were many issues:-          Balcony. Too much rust. White paint constantly falling in the floor of the balcony.-          Sofa bed. Brown, many areas were already tearing apart the fake leather, showing white spots. Looked very worn, but I tried to ignored it.-          Chair inside the cabin. The material was very clean and good but the wood was never updated and had lots of scratches.-          Bedskirt. Material was rotten.-          Lamp by the window. There is no switch that turns this lamp on and off, and to do so you have to reach for the cable behind the minibar fridge and turn off the current.-          Bathroom – I could not believe the bathroom. The bathtub… which they call Jacuzzi, is as old as the ship and has never been refinished. It even had cracks and looked dirty. I also tried to ignore. We never complained. Some of the faucets for the Jacuzzi were missing and I did not complain either because I was not going to use it. Only the shower. The material of the outside bathtub curtain is rotten. And then only after a few days, the bathtub and sink started having problems with the drainage. I complained and requested to be fixed, and they sent the boys who clean the room with some products… when they said it was fixed, I opened the water and showed them that it was not working. Finally the plumber came.. it worked for one or two days… and I kept requesting the plumber, which could only get temporary results. Then, there was water coming out of the drainage of the bathtub and the toilet WITH FECES!!!! I knew the plumber would not be able to solve the drainage problems ever. I kept being patient.Next another big problem… one day after returning from one of the trips, I started to fill the sink to wash some of our intimate clothes and the water was dark. I opened the toilet, flushed it and the water was dark. (I even keep some of that water in a glass bottle to be examined if necessary). I reported it, and first they sent someone saying the water was ok, until finally admitting to the problem. We could not have a shower. Went to the reception again and finally they accepted that there was a problem in the whole ship because during the day the water had been shut down. I asked them why there was no previous notice with such a problem. First I was told that they did send the information to the cabins – which was no true – I guess they did not know how to answer to that, and later on they said that water had been closed without them knowing anything about it.Someone was sent again to my cabin and they said I would have to wait until next day to have clean water and could have a shower. I requested a bottle of water for cleaning the mouth, face, etc. It was provided free of charge and we waited until next day when the problem was gone.-          Air Conditioning. The round control without temperature digits for the air conditioning only shows “cooler and warmer”. But no matter how you moved it, it does not work and there was dust coming out of it. I kept reporting it but nothing worked out to fix it.-          Halls on deck 9. The whole hall of deck 9 on the odd numbers, most of the time has a horrible smell. Something wrong again with the drainage…-          Aft elevators. These are the most used elevators because of the dining areas and back pool. Two of the four of them have never been able to be repaired. Not one single day they have worked.There is no way you can enjoy the peaceful and perfect cruise I was hoping for. And then finally, almost one month after, on May 18, (my 68th birthday) they offered us to change the cabin. Due to the fact that my husband is 90 years old, I had booked a cabin close to the elevators and on the back to easily reach all the dining rooms and also close to the back balcony where he could go and come to the cabin easily for the use of the bathroom.The first cabin that was offered was cat. 15, very close to the one we had and seemed to be in good condition…. I accepted it, but then it was only good for only 2 people and we are 3.The 2nd. Cabin, cat. 14, was all the way to the front. I did not accept it because the distance was too long for my husband to walk every time to the dining rooms.Then they offered cabin 9223. Has a cleaner bathtub and does not have problems. The position was good for him. Fine. The air conditioning has a control with numbers that you could easily change for the wanted temperature. We accepted it. I had to call that same day because there was no sound in the TV… and the blinking on the phone could not be deleted. Yes small things, but why not checking everything before sending us there?Then on May 21th the outside temperature was cooler. I tried to raise the temperature on the AC, from 23 but the control showed only 23 no matter how high you tried to change it. I reported it. Yesterday, May 22nd we came from the tour. The room was cold. Finally today, May 23rd, the temperature has reached 25 degrees.I also want to say that I had no problems with the beds in cabin 9187, and in this cabin 9223 the shaking on the bed is horrible, no matter how calm the sea is.I am frustrated for having so many issues. I am not the only person with problems and complaining. Many people have been changed to other cabins. Many people are dissatisfied. I wish my cabin was the only with problems, but that is not the case.I have been over 20 cruises and I cannot believe all what is happening in this ship.I know that this ship was owned originally by Holland America and that it has always had many problems of the same kind. My brother was one time in a suite and even there he had problems. I can’t believe that problems have not been fixed after so many years. If that is the case, I don’t think Cruise and Maritime Voyages will be able to fix them.When I made my reservations I did not know it was the same ship, as there are others ships from HAL that did not had that problem.I saw that the ship capacity is for 1,600 passengers and it showed that were very few cabins available so I thought it was almost full. Many categories were not available. Then when arriving in Singapore, I was told that there are only 800 passengers on board. For me that means that many cabins were not available because of the problems there are. I don’t know.It is not fair that the “trip of my life”, with such a wonderful itinerary, has had so many problems.In the dinning room of the 7th floor, where we had to go for dining, the waitresses sometimes were sweating because of the heat. It is gross to see that, and I feel really bad for them.I also have stop some of them in the ship and asked them if the air conditioning in their rooms is too cold –because I heard it- and they all confirm  it.I also want to tell you:-          The staff is great at all levels. They cannot be any better.-          Most of the night shows are very good, as well as the stage.-          The tours are well planned and I am very satisfied with the guides, except for the tour in Athens (Panorama tour of Athens, coach 5), that the tours guide was a very old lady with a cane, the microphone was not working and nobody could understand, the windows had humidity inside the glasses of the window, so you could not see outside. She at a time, told the passengers to shut up, or she would stop talking, which a tour guide should not do. The tour left late and returned 45 min. earlier. I reported it as soon as I arrived. I have been on the tourism industry all my life and never see something like this happen. I have pictures of the bus’ plate in case you are interested in having it. Your representative in the bus was very nice, but there was nothing that he could do to change the situation.-          And the best thing I applaud is the food. We are vegetarians, and we have enjoyed many gourmet choices.On May 26.1:00am. I could not sleep again due to the noisy and weird vibration that is under the bed in that cabin. Went to the reception and they said they will give us another cabin.9:00am. Finally they gave us cabin 9032. That was the only available… because it is at the front of the ship, now my husband has to use the wheelchair all the time because it is very far for him to walk to the dining areas.9:30pm. Since 5:00 pm I reported that there was not cold water in the sink and that I could not close it to wash my underwear.How are we supposed to wash our teeth? With hot water?I lost another day and was not able to visit Naples, because I finished at 3pm transferring everything. The air conditioning only works when I call them and they have to raise or lower the temperature. I cannot do it myself because the control is the round one like in the first cabin and it does not work.4:00 pm. I wanted to wash something in the sink. There is only hot water. No cold water at all and the sink does not hold the water when I try to close it.How are we supposed to wash our teeth? With hot water?Went to reception again, the plumberS came again and now the sink is working and we have cold and hot water on the faucets of the sink. The plumber mentioned that there are different kinds of problems with the temperature of the water. Some cabins very hot… some cabins cold.9:00pm. The problem with the sink and the hot water still going on.10:30 pm. Finally, after 4 times coming to the cabin the problems are solved. Hot water when you open faucet, have to wait and then water is becoming cold.People are calling the ship “Fiasco da Gama”…After getting home I called my travel agent because she had given us a credit as a gift to be used while cruising. It was a significant amount, but the reception denied it. My travel agent made the complaint and they finally send me a check for that amount. I had made several complaints to the cruise line concerning all the problems with 3 cabins. I had to send the complaint to my travel agent which then send it to them but they don't even bother to respond. I wanted to be compensated for all the problems, but nothing. Some people has been compensated with credit for future cruises in other countries, but the USA office says that that is not truth. They are not reliable. They do not take responsibility for all the problems encountered.",Sail Date: April 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Europe|,Florida

Reported to ACORN .. government crypto police.... no response . Local police believe no response because not a great deal of money.THe terrible part about this crime other than I surely cannot afford to lose this money... is that Princess Cruise Customer Relations  will do nothing so this person  sales merrily along with access to 2000 passengers at all times.... passengers who are just as vulnerable  as I was and with no recourse  available to them.

It was hard to find a quiet spot to read. The promenade deck was continually being worked on with the resulting closures, noise and fumes which were bothersome. There was a smell of sewerage through the ship for several days. The coffee,both purchased and provided was awful and the drinks were not great .  They were all very expensive compared to other boatsPatrons needed to be an hour early for shows to get a decent seat. Some people arrived early and kept seats for friends, thus denying some early arrivals a seat. This led to a few spats which the staff didn’t seem to know what to do about.

I especially like that no more than 700 guests are aboard and the overnight port stays make the itinerary enjoyable. Mosaic Cafe specialty coffees, snacks, tapas, and the daily availability of several Gelato flavors at the Windows Cafe are real plusses. Stateroom service is the best in the industry. Andre and Errol are model attendants not only with great contact skills but also very effective making sure my room was always tidy and fresh several times daily.The complimentary Azamazing Evening - An Evening Carnival at the Solis Theatre in Montevideo, Uruguay was the absolute best perk. Not only was the logistics of shuttling over 600 guests from the ship to the theatre run effectively and smoothly, the entertainment was stimulating and pertinent to the itinerary. Local talent appearing in the event were outstanding. Totally fun and an excellent shore excursion which made for great pics, vids, and memories.Negatives observed were in-fighting among bar/service staff and also arguing and a walkout fit concerning lighting from the members of the Riviera Sounds Band. The DJ, Valentino, displayed poor attitude daily with his actions and cold facial expressions concerning several requests which were not played. Additionally, Valentino interrupted a Disco evening by allowing one guest to perform her Karaoke in the middle of the dancing. He does not know how to keep guests dancing and constantly breaks the energy level and dance mood with his own selections. A severe lack of live and/or background music was observed most days around the pool area and during sail-aways; especially the first sail-away. Why have a stage at the pool area if it is only used once during White Night? The show band, Riviera Sounds, and the DJ were all underutilized. They need additional assignments providing music and setting the atmosphere in the pool area and dance floors in the Cabaret and Living Room. Azamara should adopt the Silent Disco entertainment sessions which are very well-attended and popular on Celebrity ships.I experienced the tail ends of many of the excursion orientation lectures. The speaker was unenthusiastic, had a monotone voice, and presented nothing to help me prepare for the visit to various ports. The on board singers were often off key. The singers voices sounded weak and flat especially during tribute songs. They do not seem seasoned enough voices to be considered professional entertainers. Azamara would do better to hire local singers from each port visited scheduling on board shows during long evening and overnight stays.The food was hit or miss and mostly ""miss"" concerning flavor. For example, at the Windows Cafe the lasagna was worst I've ever tasted and totally lacked quality cheese and seasonings. Desserts and pastries, while pleasing to the eye also lacked flavor. The ""Best of the Cruise"" Dinner Buffet was a misnomer and merely a repeat of most of the flavorless offerings from other days like the lasagna. Where's the cocktail shrimp, lobster tails, and crab claws which should represent the best of the cruise? Dinners at Prime C and Aqualina are slightly better in quality and flavor. Prime C definitely offered the best dinner item selections in terms of quality. Table service is better than at Windows at these specialty restaurants. Most of the food service staff are friendly, efficient, and available throughout all areas of the ship. I was able to enjoy the benefits of my Ultimate Beverage package with waitstaff tending to my needs. I was often alone by the pool or other areas and found waitstaff were good constantly asking me if I needed a drink. I was in shock and disbelief during the White Night dinner when the wait person Romeo, brought me a Pina Colada and lied to me and my party saying it contained Kraken Dark Rum. It was so obvious to all at my table that my drink was too light and definitely not made with the Kraken Dark Rum. I had to take the drink back to the bar where Ivan, the bartender understood the issue and corrected it. I took a photo of both Pina Coladas to prove the difference.My interior stateroom #6011 upon first impression was very good and is located forward on deck 6. Colors are easy on the eyes, fresh carpeting, comfy bedding, plush robes and towels, nice large screen TV, ample lighting and controls, plenty of storage, well-stocked mini-fridge, ice bucket, tongs, corkscrew, etc. However, the minuscule bathroom is a prefab unit with barely enough room to shower for a 5'9"", 165 lb. person. The shower curtain constantly clung to my body. Extremely difficult to wash my feet as bending over in shower is nearly impossible without bumping into a wall or fixture. Sink is so tiny and close to the mirror, one cannot wash face/shave without bumping head on the mirror and splashing everywhere. Toilet is strangely angled about 45 degrees into a wall and bathroom door. I cannot imagine having legs longer than mine and sitting on this toilet. The bean counters and space estimators have really had a field day on this bathroom pre-fab unit. Felt as if I had a bathroom in a small motorhome. Never experienced one on a ship as small as this. The AC unit was separately controlled in my room, infinitely adjustable and best of all; produced cold air as I needed.Tony, the Cruise Director, and Amanda, the Assistant Cruise Director were seldom if ever observed taking time to walk around guest areas. They should make much more time to greet and spot-check guest feedback along with observing and tending to any immediate issues arising throughout guest areas on the ship. As previously mentioned, I observed in-fighting among entertainment staff, servers, and poor performance from the DJ. Tony was only visible during the Daily Show on TV and during major performances; especially his own. He failed in his Cruise Director duties to guests by not being available. The Cruise Director and Assistant should announce and publish their office locations and telephone numbers at the beginning of the cruise as a courtesy to guests as other cruise lines do. I experienced many issues that needed the Cruise Director's attention but did not have a means for contact.The itinerary for this South American cruise to Rio Carnaval was about perfect save I would highly recommend an overnight at Ilhabela, Brazil. Twelve hours at Ilhabela was not enough time to explore the quaint town's nightlife and all the waterfalls. Sao Paulo (Santos), Brazil seemed to be a lackluster port merely on the itinerary to refuel the ship.SUMMARY: I was very disappointed with the lack of daily visibility of both cruise directors during this cruise. Only saw them at their shows, bingo, or on TV. They need to greatly increase walking guest areas and making individual contact with guests.Musical performances by the band, trio, and DJ need to be increased in frequency. Implement Silent Disco evenings.Overall, food is lackluster in flavor. Suggest the chef taste buffet offerings before service. MOST IMPORTANT: Azamara (and all other cruise lines) should immediately implement served buffets (not allow guests to serve themselves) in light of increasing sanitary concerns aboard cruises.",Sail Date: February 2020|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: |Destination: South America|,"Dallas, Texas"

We have sailed on 7 other cruise lines on 14 different ships. We had high expectations given they rate themselves as the best small ship 5 star cruise line and they offer intensive itineraries and longer times in port. It is a small ship so it cannot offer all the variety a larger ship can. Overall we were very happy with the ship however they did not meet our expectations to be the best. The ship has had a makeover and is in pretty good condition.The Cabin. Standard decor and layout for a balcony suite. Nice bed but terrible pillows with no other options than what is on your bed. There is 1 USB on each bedside lamp. There is a 2 seater along with a chair and desk with 2 power points (1US and 1 euro). Quite squeezy all round. The wardrobe had 2 doors and 4 draws. The drinks cabinet had some storage and another power point. Flat screen TV with a reasonable selection of TV. Reception was variable.The bathroom was tiny and the shower was tinier with just a shower curtain. I am not a large person but I could not keep the curtain away from me. A real shortcoming. Not a lot of storage and only 1 shaver point above the toilet.Staff overall were very good.Food on board was very good to excellent in the main dining and buffet. Specialist restaurants were excellent.Shore excursions were standard and similar to most cruise lines. Pricing was reasonable. As for longer times in port. They still have very short stop ports where you would get back from a shore excursion and sail immediately. No different to most cruise lines.Entertainment was limited as the ship does not have a theatre and the cabaret lounge could hold only half the guests.

Shore excursions were offered at every port but sometimes the port information we inquired about was limited.Entertainment was well worth our time in the evening after dinner.Some ports like Amalfi we would have preferred more than 10 hours to visit but thats for another time.There is one night Azamazing Nights where all the guests are entertained under the stars to hear a choir group and eat local food, wine and cheeses.",Sail Date: September 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Mediterranean|,

This company is part of the Royal Caribbean/Celebrity family of companies.  The cost of Azamara is at least double of Celebrity for the same size of room and three times the cost of Royal Caribbean.  They are using cost to imitate a high end cruise line, sorry Azamara, you’re a long way from being a top tier line.  Pros:Cabin attendant service was good, especially after a nice tip to start the cruise.Food service was good and the attitude of the servers was good.The White Night party was fun with good entertainment.While there was not any big shows, the entertainers they did have were very good.Food was OK, but not at the level of Celebrity.Bar service was good and the “free” drinks were OK.Buses for the shore excursions were good.The Captain was very communicative except then the rockets were exploding over our ship in Israel.Cons:Shore Excursions were very poor and not well defined. The ship was sold as Israel Intensive so we booked many excursions.  However, after the first excursion we learned that the next day was almost an exact repeat of the one we just completed.  The Shore Excursion desk offered (with no luck) to sell our tickets but would not let us change to a different tour.  They hid behind the 48 hour cancellation policy.  It didn’t matter that their Excursion people on the phone booked the tours and told us they were much different.  I would have expected a RCL company to stand behind their own mistakes, but they don’t have that quality of executives.  The Shsore Excursions that we took were mediocre at best.Room size is way too small and the furniture is too big for the room, look at this before booking as we had the biggest room not being a suite.  Even the comedians made fun of the room size.Conclusion:Either book a Celebrity Cruise or spend more and go to Crystal or one of the high end cruises.  This is actually the low end of the RCL company at a ridiculous price.",Sail Date: September 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Mediterranean|,"Stuart, Florida"

The drinks are included and I noticed that people's wine glasses never got empty.  The entertainment could be improved.  What entertainment there was, a violinist or a piano player or singers were very good but because the stage is small I guess that is all they could offer.  There were  musicians in the lounges and they were very entertaining.  No casino.  This cruise offerred a port every day for 9 consecutive days.  The ships tours averaged $99.  We took four of the tours but found you could do just as well by taking a cab.  The majority of the guests on board were American followed by Australians, Britains and New Zealanders.  Suprisingly there wasn't even one person with a walker. I'd say the average age of the guests was in the low 70's and maybe there were 10 children.

We went with my parents and some friends.  We have sailed on Crystal, celebrity, Holland America and other cruise lines. We crossed the Atlantic and overall had smooth sailing with the exception of the coast near Morocco. Originally, I was concerned that a 600 passenger vessel might be too small for a 17 day journey, but we loved the itinerary and the Pursuit was comfortable.  The cabin crew was amazing.  I arrived with a ruptured blood vessel in my eye which the doctor had suggested I use hot compresses on twice a day.  Our butler brought hot water morning and night until it healed. Then I felt off one day and our butler checked with my spouse to see if I needed anything and brought it without ever making a peep.  Our cabin on Deck 7 was really well placed for activities, we enjoy zen coloring, the pool, bars and more during our stay.  We had a captain change and both of them were engaging and were always happy to speak the passengers.  They may have had a new servers in the bar and at the coffee show as people didn’t always come around enough to pick-up empty glasses or to ask if one wanted a beverage.  Overall everyone from the Cabin Steward, hotel manager to the Captain, everyone was pleasant and happy to serveWe opted for private excursions through Azamara, since there were six of us and overall they were quite good.  There was only one city where we felt the guide was a bit overeager and pushy as she was launching her own business and wanted us to tell our friends who might come to her directly.

The crew represents the ship as caring about you having a memorable experience.  There package includes tips and a basic drink package which was more than adequate (good wines by the glass, good selection of beers and other more fortified offerings). The only disappointment was the size of the room ... minimal essential.  At 6'2"" and 97 kilos a shower was a daily challenge only made possible because of a shower curtain versus a door.

The ship itself is lovely however after only being a year out of dock after its refit it has a lot of minor failures, the window frame was rusty, the plastic coating used to cover the old internal walls and doors in the toilet was already pealing off and there was a hole in the ceiling in the dining room.  The waiting staff were all friendly enough however the management could do with a shake.  A “white night” was organised for 6.30 for a day that had tours that did not arrive back until 6.15 giving the guests no time to prepare, when we asked the management why we were just stared at! The food in both dining rooms is repetitive daily, bland and underwhelming. It is blatantly obvious the company has marketed for Americans for food and entertainment.

Once we crossed the Equator, mid-ocean, we stopped in Mindelo, Cape Verde, Agadir and Casablanca, Morocco and ended in Lisbon, Portugal.We were 8 days in ports and 10 days at sea. We have always enjoyed our sea days and that is the main reason we chose this particular itinerary along with the interesting ports of call. We also wanted to explore the Azamara Experience that we have heard so much about.The size of the ship was fantastic, only 600 hundred guests, with a great mix mainly from Europe, North and South America along with New Zealand and Australia. The main age range was 40's to 60's. The crew was also pretty diverse compared to what we are used to seeing onboard.  The crew could not have been more friendly and helpful throughout the journey. The public areas were all maintained to a high level as were the cabins.We were concerned about the size of our balcony room and bath but it was well designed and comfortable. The bed divine! There was plenty of closet space and drawers and there were shelves in the bath for all of our toiletries. The 'small' shower we had read about in other reviews was small but not a burden.The one disappointing thing about this cruise was the food. Hmm, where to begin. The main dining room staff was excellent but by the time food arrives to the table it is lukewarm, not hot, and tended to be over cooked from what was ordered. In the two speciality restaurants the food was better but nothing stood out as Excellent. We really did not like the buffet restaurant, we tend to not do buffets, but the open air aft terrace of the buffet was our favorite dining area. If you ordered something form the pool deck grill they would serve it to you outside. The cook to order stations at the buffet were generally the best options along with the sweets station.Our best meals were in the ports of call but we are used to exploring for out of the way really good dining options.If you like fancy stage productions this would not be the right cruise line for you. It was much more relaxed albeit entertaining. The four main performers, all singers, were talented and approachable. There was a heavy emphasis on games and trivia all around the ship during most times of the day. There is no casino onboard and we really enjoyed the Den which is where it used to be located. There were destination lectures but we only attended a couple of them as we prefer to do our research reading usually.The onboard spa was nice and the staff friendly although in the beginning they would try to upsell you until they realized you knew what you wanted. The highlight of the cruise was the well appointed gym and my personal trainer, Annica. I was able to disembark feeling rejuvenated and not having gained one pound!If you like to stay connected the internet worked perfectly fine and the movie selection on TV was decent. We had already downloaded a lot of entertainment on our personal devices to keep busy. The library had a nice selection of books to borrow and was also a nice reading spot onboard.Being an all inclusive cruise is nice, although there is a surcharge for the higher end liquors, as you are not worried about racking up a large onboard tab. The bottled waters, high end coffees and teas at will were a nice compliment.Will we cruise Azamara again?  Yes!  We truly enjoyed the ship, the crew and the fellow passengers.

Once onboard the check in took place and everything went smoothly. This wasn't our first Azamara cruise so we were able to do comparisons with the other two ships and were very highly impressed with the standard of finish on this ship, everything certainly looked very new and impressive.   Azamara has taken about a third of the staff from their two existing ships so the core 2/3rds of the staff on Pursuit were already Azamara people and from our experience that is a very good thing, in fact, the quality of the staff at Azamara is the highest of any ship we have ever been on (47 cruises).   The Casino that is still one Quest and Journey, though we understand will be going soon, has thankfully never been on Pursuit and Azamara took the opportunity to create a dynamic new area on the ship called the Den.  As well as this, the Future cruises use an area that was the old office for the Casino and shore excursions have also been brought up to deck 5.  This is a great new social hub but means the very few people that used the Casino will be disappointed, but it was totally underused and I always felt sorry for the staff left sitting waiting for the one or two that came and played BlackJack, Roulette or Poker etc..Over the years I've always enjoyed the food on Azamara and this cruise I was pleased to see many improvements to existing dishes and several new dishes to taste.  Food in the main restaurant is always great.  Another improvement to the ship is the removal of the Sunset bar, don't worry you can still get drinks out there anytime, but instead of the bar, there are more seats so more people can get out on deck.The Art Gallery is a real room now and not just a space. I understand that all of the improvements on Pursuit will soon feature on Quest and Journey.There is always plenty to do, or as little to do as you want.   The speakers on our cruise were both imformative and entertaining, Lee the assistant Cruise Director is funny and entertaining and the staff onboard all go to make Azamara a great choice.",Sail Date: February 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: South America|,Cheshire

Fabulous food, lots to do, plenty of time to relax, and great cabaret acts and movies.This time, the cruise was on the Maasdam. The layout of the ship is identical to the Vollendam, as is the decor. Again, couldn't fault the cabin or the two stewards assigned to looking after us. I will be taking another HAL cruise, because, of all the cruises that I have been on, I have found them to be the cleanest, friendliest and most enjoyable cruises. They know their clientele base and treat their passengers with respect. If I had any gripes, they are minor:Cabin television: The television was dreadful - unless you wanted to know what Donald Trump had said or done that day.  It was 24/7 of anti-Trump networks. HAL should consider upgrading their Sky subscription so people could enjoy some movies and television dramas. It is supposed to be a holiday!Cinema: Some of the movies, shown in the actual cinema, were unsuitable for the age group that sail on the 'dam' boats.  Foul language may be okay with the 45 and under age group, but it doesn't sit well with the 50+  (especially the ladies!) The occasional swear word is fine, but in the movies shown, the bad language was prolific. I know there were lots of complaints made about the suitability of the movies.Food: The salad bar was great, as was the deli section and dessert bar. However, the main food selection - which was extensive - saw that most of the vegetables were cooked in a stir-fry style. On the days that boiled or mashed potatoes, steamed cabbage, peas and Brussels sprouts were on offer, passengers were like vultures, scrambling for plain, steamed or boiled greens to accompany their meal.  This is something that HAL chefs should seriously consider.Cabaret Acts: The cabaret acts were a hit and miss affair. Each act did two shows a night, and, during the course of the journey, appeared twice. The comedian admitted, at the beginning of his act, that he had health and family problems and was recently divorced. His act was low key. Not always funny, but humorous in parts. Then he became bogged down with his `issues' and the audience were dragged down, mentally. Not a good subject for `entertainment'.  It was a good thing the casino was open, that night. It was a way that people could get back into holiday mode.  I think there must have been some complaints, because he only did one night. (Another act appeared in his planned second show).The impersonator was very good, most of the time, but there were times when he did famous lines from movies and, although the person he was imitating was projected on to a screen behind him, he didn't nail some of them. He kept slipping back into his own, accent.  His second night wasn't as good as his first act. I think he'd been enjoying `Happy Hour' beforehand. There was a female singer who portrayed a musical legend. It was a fun show and, sadly too short. However, her second show, was just her singing average songs - some of them badly.  Everyone commented that they liked her first show best. Acts should be consistent - consistently good.Everyone other act was very professional and had the `WOW' factor.  So, two or three `so-so' acts were soon forgotten. Rating Card: It's a good thing that, daily, HAL leaves a card in your cabin, where you can evaluate the `likes' and `dislikes' of the day, and also give you the opportunity to recognise the individual crew members who made your day better. If there was something, not to your liking, it was remedied, as soon as possible, or you were compensated in some way. I gave the `Maasdam' cruise an `Average' rating, here, because, although the things I felt, which weren't up to scratch - food and entertainment-wise, were minor, there was a mechanical problem, which saw the itinerary altered. Engine failure: On the journey back, the ship lost a propulsion engine and they couldn't get it fixed. The Captain was given permission to continue on the journey, but we were not allowed out to International waters. The ship had to hug the shore-line, until we reached Auckland.  This meant one of the destinations was removed from the itinerary altogether and the casino couldn't open. All-day `Happy Hour' was the solution - and a $50 refund, for not being able to call into one of the ports. Otherwise, it was business as usual and additional activities (like trivia competitions, line dancing lessons etc) were put on. Had this not happened, I would have given this HAL's Maasdam cruise 4 out of 5 stars, because the quality was there, and they did everything in their power to make you holiday fun and relaxing. This experience hasn't put me off HAL cruises. I am already saving for my next one!",Sail Date: January 2020|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: |Destination: South Pacific|,"Whangarei, New Zealand"

Love that the ships are small and appeal to an older audience, no climbing walls or water slides and only 1000 people on board.  The Maasdam is showing her age, the TV was small and reception was terrible, we hired two DVD's both of which we had to return as they didn't work.  However, the cabin stewards were fantastic, always friendly and remembered your names (even the lady in the coffee shop remembered my name and my order!)  Cannot fault HAL for their staff, food or facilities.  The cruise was well organised, the places we visited fantastic and I will definitely cruise HAL again.  My only gripe I suppose was the entertainment - some of it was really good, some was not so good, but they did put a movie on every day so if you didn't fancy the entertainment you could go to a movie.

We had an inside cabin, very good, big, quiet and comfortable, but being an inside cabin requires a good promenade deck to get out on which Maasdam has, but,  two thirds of the promenade deck have cabins that open onto the deck ( called Lanai suites) they have sliding doors that open onto the promenade deck and the deck chairs in front are reserved for the lanai suites occupants So very, very few deck chairs to be had. The food was excellent, nice dining rooms.  But  the whole ship completely lacked any rhythm or atmosphere. going to dinner for the 8 o clock sitting was like walking through an empty shopping mall, (the show room went until 8.30) nothing coordinated, but my biggest dislike was cheap American music played everywhere, country and western mostly, over cheap tinny speakers, around the swimming pools, I love yooooou, in the buffet, in every public room, the crows nest,  even in the main dining room (but a better choice thankfully) the only refuge was on the promenade deck ....and then it started there, forget listening to the waves, I love yoooou, I went in and complained to be told it was Holland Americas policy and head office chose the music, but there was a section on the very top deck where they didn't play music, 2 tables out in the open with no shade. Their dress regulations were a farce until midnight men sitting at the bar area that you had to walk through  dressed in thongs and t shirts and shorts so small I thought they were underpants, . Shorts worn to formal nights. At the evening shows, thongs and shorts  Thats all OK if that is how you market your cruise line... but I thought Holland America was positioned more upmarket, seems not, just expect a downmarket cruise and you won't be disappointed",Sail Date: September 2019|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: |Destination: South Pacific|,"Sydney, Australia"

So, was not looking forward to one that lasted 20 days.  But this trip changed my mind in a much more positive direction.  As a result, we have booked another trip with Holland America later this year out of Rome.The best (among many bests) aspect of this trip was the entire staff of the ship.  I know hotels, airlines and ships put people through training where they tell them to ""be nice"" to the customers, but ALL of these people were universally pleasant and smiling and personable.  And, without exception, it seemed to be actually GENUINE!Room and ship facilities were immaculate, even though we had the smallest inside room on the boat. Lots of storage space, great cabin steward, abundant amenities, and wonderful ventilation in the bathroom(!).Entertainment and dining were varied and superb.  I sat in on half a dozen Microsoft seminars focused on Windows 10, and learned a lot of useful things to bring home.I know we don't go on trips like this to watch TV, but the programming was a big plus for us, in that (sorry to get political) the news channels were balanced.  Yes, you could watch MSNBC (or is it MSDNC??), but you also could watch Fox News.  Best part was there was NO CNN, which is usually crammed down our throats in all airports and everywhere else around the world. Our trip was during the impeachment hearings, so we appreciated getting two sides of the issues.Only complaint re the TV was an antiquated DVD player which worked OK, but had a moderate ""hum"" in the audio.  There was an extensive library of DVD movies in the ship's library, and we made good use of that, as well.Management did a great job in handling some last minute snafu's regarding measles quarantines in some of the islands visited.  Problems were created by lack of timely notification from the island governments. The issues were overcome and no one got sick that we know of.We were fortunate with good weather for the whole 20 days, but felt sorry for the Aussies having to deal with their wild fires.Hats off to Holland America!!",Sail Date: December 2019|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: |Destination: South Pacific|,"Fort Myers, Florida"

Thus due to the freezing temperatures and stormy seas we were not able to see the Milford Sound--the jewel of such a trip.  We missed another port of call on the south island and tolerated a miserable cold and freezing rain day in ChristChurch.  After that the cruise became very agreeable with ports of call on the north island and New Caledonia very balmy.

It was a good mix of WWII history, interesting tribes and remote islands. We had some issues with non working AC in first cabin and it took two days to finally move.  This was our first customer service issue there were several more over the course of the cruise but there were also some crew members who gave outstanding service. The food was OK, very mid range cruise cuisine. We had breakfast delivered and ate in the dining room every evening. The buffet or burger/ taco bars were the only choices for lunch other than room service. We learned to time our lunches to avoid the crowds.The ship was a big enough for managing the Pacific seas but not too large. The lectures were wonderful, BUT the showroom at sea had the worst layout and seat comfort of any theater I have ever been in.  They had to bring in folding chairs and dining chairs to accommodate  the crowd which occasionally caused raised voices over seating availability. The in room TV was ancient and the internet availability and price were silly expensive for the speed. Many times we were out of range.  If we had not just finished 2 previous cruises this summer, I might not have noticed but with them both fresh in my mind the quality and cost of internet and TV programming on this cruise was sub par.Bottom line this is a 3 star hotel.

Unfortunately all of them bias the food toward carbohydrates and sugar laden products. Good news is that the ship had a great salad bar. Also the crew were happy to mix the protein from one dish with a salad or vegetarian dish. What a waste of food though when so much is left on the plate.The entertainment has been good. None of those production shows as on the bigger ships. It was far more intimate.Being a smaller ship it could get 8nto different ports.On board lectures have been varied and interesting.

It also means that you can get to know more guests if you want to do that.  We had breakfast in the dining room each day and were usually sharing the table with four other guests.  We were from all over.  We were first-time travelers and frequent sailers.  We exchanged plans and stories in the morning and then reviewed the day's activities if we saw these folks later in the evening.The cabin service met our expectations.

The staff are generally still as friendly as ever, but dining room service was often slow and meat cooking requests not performed correctly.  Pretty much gone are the special dinners and presentations as well as the ice sculptures.  Much of the time we ate in the LIDO with Japanese friends, but the dishes there can be hit or miss.  The pho was faux, the chile relleno less than acceptable and the pizza rather soggy.  The new EXC program comes at the expense of the quality and variety of the lounge entertainment, but the EXC speakers were generaly good, certainly knowledgable, and cruise movies chosen spot on and topical.  EXC shore excursions and general shore excursions were a bit high (perhaps 30% or more above available alternatives). The room and cabin service was fine.  This is the second time for me aboard the ship (the last time was in 2001) and I can say that the Maasdam has been refurnished and has aged fairly well. However, she is one of four oldest sisters, two of which have already been retired from the line.  The biggest hit on the cruise was the impressive display of towel animals on deck by the pool and the crew show.  We sail with the Maasdam again in August.  To put things in perspective, Oceania offers food and service more in line with 1980s-1990s HAL, but the price is much higher.

Sadly the Maasdam was much older and smaller and had a limited budget for food etc. Our cabin on deck 10 had several problems. The AC was not working properly despite setting it on the coldest level ( we were cruising Asia and it was very hot @ 34*C ). The room was always warm and the AC seemed to work like a fan so it never managed to get cool enough despite our 40 days cruise . The thermostat on our shower was either very hot or cold and we had to tweak it ever so slightly before getting in having been nearly scalded the first time. There was always some strange noise coming through the AC vent at really odd times ( past midnight or around early hours of the morning ). We couldn’t work it out for a very long time until one day , I was by the ice machine on deck 11 ( The Lido ) where the engineer was working . He was filling it with ice after some work on it and when he shut the door , it rattled and “ the noise “ was exactly what we had been hearing in our bedroom below !Wait staff and lower level staff and our room attendants were all so helpful and friendly. Sadly we couldn’t say that for middle level staff and above. Despite several calls to the reception to get the AC and shower thermostat repaired, and despite three visit by the engineer , the problems were never resolved. We just gave up !Food in the main dining room ( The Rotterdam dining room ) was so average and the only decent food we enjoyed was on Gala nights ( formal nights ).Wines were so overpriced ...a mediocre supermarket cheap bottle of Malbec which would cost £6 would be charged at USD 42. However we found a palatable Aussie Shiraz at USD28 which ( inclusive of the mandatory 15% tax ) would cost USD 32 . But this “ran out “ halfway through the cruise. The ship’s excursions which we took were generally good but overpriced . We noticed that HAL now docks at cheaper and much further away ports so there is much wastage of time on coaches to reach certain cities eg Ho Chin Minh. It took us two hours to get to HCM and we were given 5 hours to look around before having to return to coach by 3pm despite the fact that the ship was not sailing off until 8pm. This is just one of the examples which made our cruising experience a disappointment. The plus points are that the lower level staff ( waiters and room attendants ) are so lovely , hard working and helpful and the itinerary of ports were interesting.

(Yes, its for people like us who don't stay up late partying and like some of the more ""genteel"" entertainments -- cooking classes, academic lectures and classical music.)  Anyway, the deal was so good, that I thought, ""heck, why not?"" and I booked our 20 day cruise and added an extra few days on our own in the Florida Keys since we landed in Ft. Lauderdale and who knows when we'll be there together again.So, we left in late April for almost a month away from home.  (Our front yard sprinklers broke while we were gone -- so we had quite a lawn regeneration project once we got home....we now have a gardener.)We started our adventure as we like to do, via train.  We got a ride to the Riverside Metrolink Station and rode it to Orange where we hopped onto a transfer to Oceanside. From Oceanside, we just jumped on the Coaster (San Diego County's commuter train) and ended up a the Santa Fe Depot in San Diego, just a short walk downhill to the cruise terminal.  The terminal is right near the Star of India at the San Diego Port. It was a stress-free, cheap way to get to our boat without inconveniencing those we love.Our cabin had a large window (there aren't that many lanai cabins on this boat). But the large window was wonderful for natural light and looking out one side of the boat.  We attended some cultural classes on Mexico and made some paper flowers. We attended every lecture on the history and construction of the canal.Our first stop was Puerto Vallarta.  On our Mexico Riviera cruise a couple of years ago, we had the best time on a jungle 4 wheel drive, mule ride, zip-line, rappelling, water slide (and more) adventure.  As much as we both loved that, we wanted to try something new. So, this time, we arranged for an ATV adventure into the jungle.  We felt safe and had a great time in the mountains and then at a sweet family owned cafe on the beach of a little hidden cove before our ride back to the ship.Once we got to the Peninsula in Southern Mexico and Guatemala, we saw several Mayan ruins. We didn't get to any of the huge ones, but, still they were very interesting and the bus rides through the cities and towns let us see a lot of people, cars, houses and gave us a glimpse of life in Southern Mexico and Central America.Going through the Panama Canal was an all day affair -- starting in the Pacific Ocean and coming out the other end in the Carribean Sea in the Atlantic.  Bucket list item -- check!  I read the David McCullough book ""The Path Between the Seas"" several weeks before we embarked, just to get a full understanding the the canal.  Bottom line, it was politically difficult, France tried and failed.  Roosevelt pushed hard;  the land was once Colombian but the US fomented a bit of a revolution to create Panama.  The Americans came in and finished it but with tons of deaths from Yellow Fever and years and years of problems and setbacks.From there great days in Aruba (scuba and a fun bus tour of the island).  The second stop was Curacao.  There we snorkeled and visited the town and a museum (with free wifi). Our final stop was Turks and Caicos.  We tried SNUBA there but, after the freedom of SCUBA in Aruba, we found that being tethered to our oxygen tanks cramped our style.We asked some of the locals from our Snuba excursion where to eat and spend some time and they recommended this little beach place, Jack's Shack, a short walk from the ship, and they were right.  The food and location couldn't be beat..  I kept my bathing suit on most of the time, so after lunch, went out for a float.  These sweet kids were playing in the water near me.  I rescued their boogie boards several times when they went astray and before you know it, we were all playing together....just me and these sweet kids. They called me Miss Annette and one of the little girls said my eyes looked like blue diamonds.  We became truly the best of friends and this was one of the best times I had in this long, fun vacation.  I could have stayed for hours except for one thing.  I didn't bring sun screen and I knew my time in the sun was overspent.  I had to say good bye to these fun, friendly kids and hit the shade.After landing in Fort Lauderdale, we headed to Key Largo for a couple of nights in an AirBnB cottage rental.  We enjoyed Key Lime Pie, driving down the Overseas Highways to Key West, a day at Everglades National Park, a trip to an alligator farm, a ride on an air boat through the everglades and a fun dinner cruise and tour of very expensive homes in Fort Lauderdale on the Jungle Queen.",Sail Date: April 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Mediterranean|,United States

I was not terribly nervous about getting sick, but I wondered how RC would handle the scare.  I was very impressed with the lengths they went to in terms of cleaning, sanitizing and providing plenty of Purell everywhere on the ship.  In fact, going into every dining area they had a few of their perkier staff members literally making sure every person sanitized upon entering.  Crew members washed every banister and handle daily. I'd say they really couldn't have done any more to prevent sickness.Wanted to react to one of the previous review where a reviewer said the RC ship/cruise didn't meet their expectations.  This is probably my 14th cruise with RC and I felt the value or the money is tremendous.  We have also cruised with Celebrity and one cruise on Princess.  Was the cruise experience as elegant as 20 years ago..nope, but the price was hardly more than it cost 20 years ago! It would be impossible to rent an Airbnd home and cook your own meals for the amount we spent   I couldn't believe that they even had smoked salmon in the breakfast buffet (probably $12 a pound in a grocery store).  We are not the kind of cruise people that eat everything in sight,  but the dinners in the main dining room was good.with a nice variety.  We bought a Dining Package tot the specialty restaurant (3 dinners for $80) which was truly worth every cent.  The  nightly entertainment in the Theatre was nothing close to Broadway.  But, the entertainment  throughout the ship in the many lounges was excellent.  I thought the service was wonderful.   Some day I want to try cruising on a higher level premium cruise line  like Oceania or Regent Seven Seas where the quality will be better, but the price tag goes along accordingly.  The prices are at least double, triple or four times the price we paid. Did RC meet my expectations for a relaxing vacation at a great price?

While it did rock a tiny bit more than the larger ships we've been on, it really was no problem and was actually quite pleasant when trying to go to sleep. While it is a few years old, built in 2002 with a minor refurbishment in 2012, it truly did not show its age. This is a real testament to the attention Royal Caribbean puts toward maintenance and upkeep. While it does not have the same variety of recreational facilities as found on the large 5,500 passenger Oasis Class ships, it had everything we wanted. We're retired and look for a relaxed vacation in the sun and taking an 11 night cruise on the Eastern Caribbean provided an excellent experience – we thoroughly enjoyed it. It appeared at least 75% of the passengers were also retirees so the atmosphere and pace was a little slower and more laid back - it was perfect. As we've come to expect with Royal Caribbean, the entire crew is warm, friendly and helpful. It doesn't matter what you ask them to do or what your issues might be, nothing is ever a problem for them and help is always provided with courtesy and a smile. Our cabin was clean, did not look dated and everything worked. While it was minor, our only complaint was the lack of plug-ins at the bedside tables to charge our phones at night while keeping them available to see what time it is when you wake up. Plugs were provided on the desk. We’ve been on newer ships and they had the bed-side plug-ins so we’re thinking it was not a demand in 2002 when it was built. The food was fabulous – always fresh and good variety on both the Windjammer all-day buffet and the evening dining room. If you’re looking for the type of vacation described above, which our category ratings are based on, we highly recommend the Serenade of the Seas and this 11 night cruise.",Sail Date: February 2020|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Caribbean|,"Burlington, Canada"

So, I can compare and contrast between the two cruises.First, the crew works very hard, but it is apparent to me that management is making them do more with less.  Business decisions by management have reduced service crew numbers.. fewer stateroom attendants, fewer dining staff in the main dining room and Windjammer.  Business policies reduce the quality of MDR and Windjammer meals thereby driving clients to the other onboard dining options.  Everything is more expensive, but lesser in quality driving the vacationers to spend more the achieve the previous level of service once a hallmark of Royal Caribbean.  This will figure greatly in my future vacation decisions.My opening foray is to get to the point quickly.  RCCL has changed how they do business since our first cruise in 2001.  This was our second outing on Serenade and while the ship hasn't changed, how the ship is run from a vacation point of view is dramatic.  This did not meet my expectations for the price I paid.Our cabin, 9654, was as expected, but the aforementioned staff reductions mean the room is not deep cleaned.  Placing the suitcases under the bed I found trash and layers of dust.  This is not an affront to the stateroom attendants.  They are not given the time to adequately clean these rooms, plus they have been assigned even more rooms than past cruises.Main Dining Room (MDR) and Windjammer have reduced staff as well.  This is apparent in the availability of waitstaff, but more apparent in quality, quantity, and selection of food choices.  Every day was groundhog day with two or three exceptions.  Meals were rushed, bland, and rehashed.  Servers were harried and stretched between too many tables of demanding guests.  This is a business decision by RCCL to drive cruisers to the other paid restaurants onboard.  Additionally, RCCL may as well change their dress policies since they are never enforced by anyone at any level in any restaurant onboard.  This is not only on Serenade by every other RCL ship I have been on.Bars and Lounges - failed utterly in my opinion.  I drink martinis - Bombay Sapphire, very dry, olives.  It is not a hard drink to make but was beyond the ability of ANY bartender to get correct.  I finally had enough of bad martinis and went to the main theater bar to hold bartender training.  This applied to every drink regardless of type.  Additionally, if you don't by a deluxe drink package you can expect less alcohol in your drinks.  I don't make this charge lightly.  I sat and observed after the 3rd day of an 11-day cruise.  I purchased a drink card on day 8 and voila!  All martinis (even the bad ones) were filled to the top, all whiskeys were more than three drops (or one finger).  Apparently the additional funds opened the flood gates of the heavy-handed pour. The onboard entertainment was also-ran and mediocre.  I guess it is due to budget cuts.  The main theater shows were sub-par making even below average headliners look better in the marquee.  This ship's band outshined the performers regularly and carried them in most cases.Saving of chairs on the pool deck, Centrum, and other venues are rampant regardless of the ship's policy.  Again, change the rules you have no intention of enforcing then I don't have the expectation of finding a chair and join the masses running for seats and chairs at the beginning of each day to carve out my piece of the pie.",Sail Date: February 2020|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Caribbean|,"Hawthorne, Florida"

It did not help with check-in. In fact, there was a snafu in my case. I had to wait in line to check in, like everyone else, and when finally it was my turn to be checked-in I was asked for a colored card. What?  No one told me about a colored card - which had nothing to do with the Key program, and there were no instructions on how to obtain it and no signs anywhere in the entrance saying you had to have it.  I was told to sit and wait until someone sorted it out.  After waiting a long time, I got angry and barged into an open spot and demanded to see a manager since I was supposed to have a special check-in.

We were a party of 4 - two adults and two 20yo daughters - two cabins, both balconies.We figure that Royal Caribbean assigns their newer, flashier, larger, expensive ships to routine (boring) destinations.  They use their older, smaller ships for more interesting destinations at a less expensive price.  Know the trade off going in and you'll have the correct expectations.   The Serenade of the Seas is a lovely basic ship.  We always found places we wanted to be - whether curled up in a wicker chair on aft deck 11, behind the Windjammer or on deck 12, lounging in the sun out front of the gym.   The ship is very clean, although just a bit worn in places. In particular it shows it's age in the cabins where the only outlets available are by the vanity.  If you want to charge your phone bedside or if you have a CPAP, you might consider bringing a couple of extension cords.  Wooden case goods show a good bit of wear.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  In particular we enjoyed our cabin steward Sonya and our waitress at dinner Christine from Jamaica and her assistant Prana. Christine knew we enjoyed a cheese plate before dinner and had one waiting for us.  Prana knew our drink orders after just one visit and was on top of service for the rest of the cruise.  Food was good but unexceptional.  We ate in the dining room 5 nights, in the Italian specialty restaurant  Giovanni's once and the Asian restaurant, Izumi, once and the Windjammer buffet the rest of the time.  The specialty restaurants were just not that special.  (I had been on Anthem of the Seas is July and the specialty restaurants, Jaime and Wonderland, were mind-blowingly, memorably spectacular!)  So I wouldn't waste money on them on this ship unless you just want a change of pace.Our itinerary included starting with a relaxing two days at sea, then St Thomas, where we enjoyed a peaceful day on a beautiful quiet beach on the Secret Sands Beach Getaway.   On Dominica - our first time here to this tiny jewel of an island! - we visited Emerald Pool and Trafalgar Falls.  Both well worth a visit and gave us an overview of this breath-taking tropical island!  On St Kitts and Nevis we went on a Catamaran trip on the One Love with Mystic Cruises which was great fun!  Antigua, another new destination for us,  was beautiful and we enjoyed the day on a catamaran.  And on St. Maarten, which we've been to many times,  we went out with Billy Bones and had an awesome day!  Highly recommend them!  Then we had two more days at sea on our way back to Fort Lauderdale.   Fantastic destinations and I love that there were sea days at the beginning and end.Entertainment was desperately bad. The stand-up comedian was awful. The song and dance shows were poor.  They really need to upgrade this even though this is a smaller ship.  Whether it's the sound system that needs help or we had the D team, I don't know.  They had a piano guy in the Schooner Bar nightly that was just plain repetitive and scary like an automaton!!   I know we had pretty great entertainment on Anthem of the Seas so I don't know if this is another case where the newer the ship, the better the entertainment?  I love live entertainment and wanted to love these guys, but just couldn't.  We took to sitting in the back of the theater so we could leave unobtrusively if we wanted.  Other than that, there was karaoke, bingo, casino and bars - the basics.  Oh, there are two gyro-stabilized pool tables that were fun but they were always crowded with kids on our trip.  There was a dart bard in the Pub-type bar.The other guest were interestingly more multi-national than on other ships we've been on.  That was really nice.

I was disappointed with Serenade for several reasons:  seemed that there was not enough staff onboard--lots of things left dirty and tables not cleaned.  Others were not helpful in several areas, unhappy even.  Also, the food was lacking--no dessert was sweetened with American sugar (Euro sugar is less sweet), so they were lackluster at best.  Many were just pain bad.  Noteable exceptions were the Coconut ranger cookie (a RCL classic) and the apple tart at dinner.   Otherwise, the desserts were a big let down.  Overall, the ship is run down and needs an overhaul.  I understand this is scheduled for 2020 or 2021.  I wouldn't sail on this one until then.  The entertainment in the Tropical Theater was not that great.  The singers and dancers were good, just the production sometimes was cheesy and not that great.

Who makes sure they are safe?,"This being my first cruise, I had no idea about the excursions.  I was under the assumption that if you purchase your in port excursions through the ship, the tours will be held to the same standards as the ship.  WRONG.  When you purchase the excursions, they tell you to buy through the ship because the ship will wait for your return should something happen.  If you book outside a ship excursion, the boat will not wait if you are late.  This information led me to believe that the ship excursions were run by the ship.  Our excursion in Belize was fun, however coming back we were stuck in a traffic  jam on the 2 lane road caused by accidents.  Driving past the accidents there was a bus overturned and several other cars crashed.  Only upon googling and talking to other passengers did we find out that one of the buses with Ship passengers was involved in an accident: they rear ended another truck. Looking back now, I am horrified that I didn't realize I was taking my life in my own hands. The bus was an old U.S. school bus and our driver was speeding and passing trucks and tankers on the windy road.  I consider myself lucky to have survived our tour, but a simple google search will provide plenty of proof that many tour ship excursions end in tragedy.  There are law firms that handle just cases from passengers injured, or killed on excursions or on the ships themselves.  Accidents happen, but if I knew then what I know now, I would not have booked any excursion in ports.  I write this review to make other passengers aware that the ship is not in control of these 3rd party vendors past booking the tours for you.  Many tours are in countries that do not have the same safety precautions as the United States.  Do your research and just be aware before you get on a bus by a driver who may or may not be skilled, trained, or even sober.",Sail Date: November 2019|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: |Destination: Mexico|,"Grant-Valkaria, Florida"

We normally cruise with the smaller ships, 200 to 350 passenger capacity.Spoiler alert: we are definitely small ship people.The destinations on this New England/Maritimes cruise are top-notch and make the trip worthwhile, as does the convenience of beginning and ending in the port of Boston. As Cape Codders this meant a vacation with zero airports; a huge plus for us.Our balcony room was small but efficient, and very clean. The bed was super comfortable and we slept great. Amazing crew full of sincere smiles and many of them seemed to learn our names quickly; always makes you feel welcome.However, the high volume of passengers aboard meant breakfasts and lunches eaten in a huge buffet room, with serving stations piled high with a variety of food that sits a bit before it ends up on your plate. Think towering piles of bacon and basic steam table fare. I just find this type of presentation unappetizing and unappealing and I was quite tired of the days first two meals by the end of the week. A very crowded and frenetic dining experience. The food taste was generally ""meh"" at these meals. But, they really do dinner quite well w three smaller specialty restaurants and an option to eat in the main dining room at a table for two. The waitstaff at all venues were fantastic and generous and personable. The Japanese venue, Izumi, is beyond exquisite and we ate there more than any other place over the course of the week. There were some very good singers and musicians playing very basic wedding type music a lot of the time, very safe and middle-of-the-road song choices sung by very talented performers. The ship seems most popular to a crowd that seems to skew Republican and evangelical; lots of MAGA hat types wearing bible-verse sweatsuits. While the ship promotes an LGBTQ ""meet and greet"" every night, it is held at the most remote and out of the way bar, at a half hour before mid-night, so it feels as if Royal is both giving us a polite nod while mostly keeping our existence safely away from their core guests who might be offended by our presence. A bad look, IMO.This ship is clean, well-run, and decidedly mostly for older, heterosexual middle-Americans. I felt our gayness was tolerated, but our obvious ""east coast elite"" status was what truly set us apart from the majority of guests.

However it began to go down hill when I entered my room at 1 pm to drop off my carryon luggage and use the bathroom. I found my toilet had not been flushed since the last cruise had had a BM.  My steward was not thorough, the next morning I found I was missing the hair dryer. Not a great beginnning.. My room was placed near a crew door and from 11:00 to 12:30 am the door slammed constantly, the vaccum rattling my door handle. Needless to say I slept  with a chair at the door.  Knowing there was an empty cabin on my deck I went to Guest services to request a room change. I was met with resistance, until I mentioned I had already spoken to a supervisor about this matter.  The next room was quieter, BUT I recieved several insect bites .. including a tick bite.. (the trip before this was to the Maine coastal/Canada trip and apparently my room housed some hikers)  My room was checked for bedbugs and the same same linens were put back on my bed for more bites the the next nite.The first nite i had a 5:30 dinner sitting.. Only after one of my table mates complained at 5:58 was our order taken.The head waiter avoided our table until the food was served. What we noticed collectively as a table was that the dining room was disorganised and the head waiter was the cause in our area. I am allergic to dairy and there was nothing on the menu that was dairy free for me, so I was never sure what I was going to get for food. What I received was not close to what I ordered and often not as palatable .The only accommodation they had was soy milk for my coffee. No substitutes for butter or sour cream.. I had 5 nites with a dry baked potato substituted, no gravy etc.The schedule of daily activities was not unlike that of my friend's assisted living activities schedule.. They did have a wonderful band called Island Vibes.. tho.I normally love RCCL, but overall this was a lack luster trip, with a staff that clearly were not happy.  .

Hurricane Jerry diverted us to Portland, Maine for one day, and then the captain did a good job of getting us around the storm and to Bermuda a day later than planned.  We knew the ship wasn’t one of the newer ones in the fleet, but having traveled other lines on less-than-new ships we weren’t worried. Our cabin was fine, other than a LOT of wear on the couch. I refused to even sit on it. Our cabin attendant was FANTASTIC and kept the bed freshly made and the bathroom spotless.  The 3-foot diameter (at most) circular shower was a challenge, and we aren’t big people.  The balcony was nice, but the glass(?) was in dire need of cleaning, from the start of the cruise, so we knew it wasn’t just from our time at sea.  Lots of food choices in the Windjammer for breakfast and lunch, but we ate dinner every night in the main dining room. Our waiters were incredible, quickly remembering our names and our preferences.  Entertainment options were mixed—a comedian whose “family-friendly” show really pushed the limits. Great live orchestra, dancers and singers. Main gathering area, the Centrum, is small and has cramped seating on the first level, or you can sit on one of the floors above and see we’ll.  I was really surprised at how small the two pools were—REALLY small, but then there’s a kiddie pool and water slides on an upper deck. A very nice miniature golf course is on the upper deck.  We found that if it wasn’t too hot or windy, the helicopter pad at the bow of the ship was a nice place to sit or experience sailing into or away from harbor.  Lots of “encouragement” to shop onboard, buy photos, bid for artwork, or shop for outrageously expensive jewelry and watches in port.

Also the menus were quirky versions of many well-known recipes, meaning we'd order what we thought we knew and ended up with something very different. Our cabin was on the top floor, just under the pool area. We like the outside balcony cabins; they are spacious and being able to sit out on the balcony in the morning or evening is a special treat. The room location was fine for the most part, except for the crew deciding they needed to throw chairs around when cleaning the deck at 5.00am. The noise woke us up on multiple mornings and continued for several days after we had alerted the staff to the problem. We go on vacation to relax and enjoy our rest. Being woken at 5.00am meant we were too tired in the evenings to enjoy the nighttime entertainment.

We prefer to plan our own trips and see things on our own. We chose the Baltic cruise on Royal Caribbean because of the 3 day stop in St. Petersburg and we didn't want to try Russia on our own.  It was a mistake we will not make again.  If we ever cruise again, it will not be with RCI.The food and service on Serenade of the Seas were good, if somewhat repetitive. The entertainment was acceptable but not exceptional.  The facilities were nice but somewhat tired.  My main complaints with this cruise are with the way Royal Caribbean operates. Everything is designed to sell, sell, sell. They start trying to upsell you the moment you step on the ship with upgraded meal packages, drink packages, internet packages, photos, excursions, etc.  Very annoying and overpriced.As for the ports of call, it seems that they berth the ship as far away from town as they can to encourage passengers to book their overpriced excursions.  They provide very little information on where the ship is berthed or what transportation options there are to reach town. There were no port briefings on things to see. If you don't want to use RCI's excursions at each stop you should do a little research prior to your trip.  Try to find out where the ship will be berthed in each port and what type of public transportation is available.  Print out a map of each town you will visit and decide what sites you wish to see.  If you decide you don't want to do this and let RCI do it for you, that's your choice of course, but be prepared to travel with bus-loads of fellow cruisers and to pay RCI's exorbitent excursion prices.  Prior to our departure we used the internet to pre-book our excursions in St. Petersburg and Warnemunde for far less money and with far fewer passengers.  For the other ports we used the public bus system, taxis or our feet to get around.The cabin is small but fine for two people.  The cabin amenties are non-existent.  One small hotel-size hand soap each week and a liquid soap dispenser in the shower. No shampoo or lotion to be found.  Nothing in the mini-fridge unless you order it separately.  Not even a bottle of water unless you buy their overpriced drink package.  Nothing in the stateroom to write with or on. Outrageous internet fee.  But it was not all terrible.

I was told it is the same in all RC ships, and it was not comfortable at all.The RC app is a very good idea - too bad it  doesn't always work in the real world and needed many restarts during the day.We tried specialty drinks ( 1 coffee, 1 alcoholic and one mocktail) , the mocktail was good but the other terrible especially for the price of 12$ before 18% tip. Quality of food in main dining room - 7/10 Main dining room service 10/10	Quality of food in Windjammer (buffet) 7/10						Service at Windjammer 9/10									The specialty restaurants (extra charge) Chops Grille (American, Meat) Giovanni's Table (Italian) 10/10 If you get a discount, you should try these. The food is noticeably better than in the main dining hall.Breakfast in Windjammer - tends to be very very busy, and it takes some times to find a place to seat.Guest services staff  10/10 Service was terrific!  All staff members tried to help and find solutions, smiling, positive. Service - We got Alemao and Dehiby as waiters in the main dining hall, and Ikomang as room attendant. They were all excellent 10/10 and we gave them an extra tip.Staterooms - very clean, but design feels outdated (and uncomfortable as mentioned) Entertainment -  8/10Daytime Activities (Rock Climbing Wall, Mini Golf, Dance Classes, Pool Side Events, Contests, Enrichment Classes, Lectures,etc.)	7/10Arcade - very small arcade, with around 20 machines. It was deserted when I visited it during rainy days, and it was July (many kids on board)General : * I wish they would state the names of the cruise piers in each destination in advance, as it might lead to confusion when you tour by yourself.* The cruise felt like it was best for the adult crowd, less for families with children.*Embarkation - Swift and easy. Leaving the ship on disembarkation was also a very fast process, while in Disney it took a long while.*Duty free or not, the shops on the ship changes the stock everyday, but the prices are pretty expensive. I saw there a Russian chocolate they sold for 7 Euros, found it was sold for 2 Euros in St.Petersburg. * The Itinerary is pretty good, since the cruise began and ended in Stockholm and that enabled us to visit the city for a total of 5 days. The stops in Tallinn, Visby and Helsinki were too short (last boarding time 15:30 to 17:00), but those city are much less to offer than Stockholm. St.Petersburg is a marvel - try to book a cruise that docks there at least 1 night (equals 2 days in the destination).",Sail Date: July 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Europe|,"Beersheba, Israel"

Enough room for a couple of chairs and a small table and what else do you need? Room for wine and snacks. A great spot to read and escape a bit. The ship is super clean. The main gathering area has the feel of an intimate night club. Tiers of balconies surround the dance floor, so you can enjoy the party at the bar level or up above. Specialty restaurants are all very good. Izumi is a bit off the beaten track, but well worth the trek! We love the Schooner Bar (site of many a trivia contest) and the nearby Wine Bar. The main dining room, like so many these days on cruise ships is less and less populated as people migrate to specialty restaurants or the Windjammer. Love the Windjammer for breakfast and lunch, but it just does not feel special enough for dinner. If you are a Diamond member, you get key card access to the Diamond Lounge, which overlooks the pool. They offer complimentary snacks and drinks and we loved going there to chat with old friends and new. The hostess there is so good at getting people to come out of their shells. We always had a great time up there and came away with new friends and fun experiences to share. We also enjoyed staying on the ship for ports we've already visited. There's always something to do....or nothing at all! Loved going back to our cabin in the evening and finding everything tidy and clean. We've started to veer away from tour packages. Not because they are not good. They are! But if just seems that no matter where you go, you've got a couple or three cruise ships in port and those package tours are more packed than ever. We usually curate our own tour on line by scoping out cool restaurants, museums, and artist's studios. Getting cabs or even walking is an option for these personalized jaunts.

We only had one sea day and a few days were 5-6 hour tours so there wasn't too much free time.  It was hard to find 2 lounge chairs in the pool & solarium areas, but eventually they did open up.

This was a seven-day cruise, 2 days in St. Petersburg.My wife and I traveled with a small group of 2 other couples, first I want to say the food on the Serenade of the Seas was fantastic! We ate breakfast in the WindJammer and those breakfasts were great. The waiters and waitresses got to know us by the second or third day, and they usually stopped to chat, make sure our coffee cup was filled, and were both personable and helpful. We also enjoyed both the food and the service in the formal dining room, deck 4, as well as our waiter - Niraj, a very professional and competent man, the assistant waiter, Milos, from Prague – who was always smiling, but we want to especially mention Jose who was the 4th person in the dining room hierarchy (maitre de?). Jose was from the Philippines as were many people in our party, and once we talked to him and were introduced; he made sure we well served. He stopped often to chat, had chocolate covered strawberries left in our cabin as a surprise, and two very special made Filipino dishes in addition to the regular menu.I need to say; I over ate the first couple of days and had to cut back on the last three days. But even by cutting back, I had excellent salmon and ""fish of the day.""We only did two ship excursions, the ballet Swan Lake in St. Petersburg, which we enjoyed immensely, and a short bus tour of Helsinki. We were a bit disappointed by the Helsinki tour, it was very short and the ""time"" allotted to visit certain sites was literally only 5 minutes. The guide was nice, but the timing was poor in our opinion. Two of the elderly women in our party could barely get off the bus in 5 minutes. My wife and I did do walking tours, on our own in both Visby and Tallinn and we thoroughly enjoyed both old cities.

Be wary of scheduling shore tours with Royal Caribbean in advance.  We only found out when we read the brochure on the ship that some required extensive walking up and down hills on cobblestones which did my bad knees no favors.  The tour guide in Vizby was more interested in making small talk with the driver than keeping the group informed.  The only restroom available at one stop was under repair and the driver wouldn't unlock the bus restroom so ladies disappeared into the woods and did the best they could.  Tallin and the guide were nice as was the case in Helsinki.

My, how things have changed since our first one. Start with check-in out of Copenhagen. We dropped off our check-in bags which would be delivered to our rooms later that Sunday morning/afternoon. Once we arrived in our room, our sea pass cards were there. The sea pass is the single most important item passengers carry. It's used when you order drinks, make purchases in the gift shop and, most important, when you leave and re-enter the ship for day excursions. You DO NOT want to lose your sea pass card. Speaking of drinks, we opted to purchase the daily unlimited drink plan (good for any drink $12 or less). The Baltic Sea cruise stops included Stockholm, Tallinn, Estonia, St. Petersburg, Russia, and Helsinki. We had two days at sea, which gave us time to just kick back and relax. With around 3,000 guests on the ship, you'd think it would be bumper-to-bumper people. Not really. There were areas that were so popular (popular trivia contests at the cozy Schooner Bar, for example) that seating was at a premium. One of my favorite hangouts, of course, was the casino. I was pleased to see table games, including my favorite, craps. Most of our meals came at the Windjammer Cafe on the 11th deck, a massive buffet featuring pretty much anything you could want. The desserts alone were unbelievable. There were shows each night in the Tropical Theatre and movies in the Cinema on deck 6. The daily excursions were as educational as they were enjoyable.

Overall, I've personally taken about 10 cruises with various lines, mostly in the Caribbean, since 2004.  We sailed on the Empress of the Seas in March because we wanted to check out Cuba.  That cruise left a lot to be desired, so I was a bit concerned about how our Baltic Sea cruise would turn out.  Thankfully, the Serenade of the Seas is a MUCH nicer ship, and we had a better cruise experience.  However, as with any cruise we take, we sailed because of the itinerary, not for the ship/cruise line.The Serenade is a great ship.  It is kept clean and organized with a pleasing layout.  The ship has a lot of blue and green hues with purple lighting in the centrum.  We liked the Safari Club at the back of the ship on Deck 6.  We also loved the Solarium pool area towards the front of the ship on Deck 11.  As for our cabin, we had a mid-ship interior cabin on Deck 4 - it seemed to be one of the larger cruise cabins we remember.  The cabin wasn't exactly new, but it was clean & and in good condition.  We did not feel cramped, but, then again, we weren't in the room too much.After a really terrible dining experience on the Empress, we opted to purchase the speciality dining package before the cruise.  This was $168/pp for 7 dinners and 2 lunches (one on each sea day).  We had three restaurants to choose from - Chops Grille, Giovanni's Table and Izumi.  We enjoyed all 3, and Giovanni's Table had the best desserts!  Izumi was my favorite overall restaurant, whereas my husband, of course, loved Chops Grille.  As for ""included"" food, we mostly dined in the buffet area for breakfast.  It was your standard cruise ship breakfast - it's really hard to mess up breakfast foods!  The coffee, of course, is sub-par, so it is wise to get a coffee card if you are a coffee drinker.  The specialty restaurants seemed to have better coffee available, however.  I can't speak to the main dining room, but we didn't hear anyone complain about their food, so I'm guessing it was at least adequate.  Since we did not use the main dining room services, we asked guest services to remove the automatic gratuity for dining so that we could tip our servers individually.  They understood our request and happily obliged.Service on the ship was good, but not outstanding.  Although, we did have a few folks who went above and beyond such as our stateroom attendant and a few of the waiters in the specialty restaurants.This particular cruise sailed from Copenhagen.  I must say, embarking at Copenhagen terminal was a breeze!  It was easily the most efficient cruise embarkation we have ever had.  Debarkation was even faster!  We would gladly sail out of Copenhagen again!We visited 4 Baltic Sea capitals - Stockholm, Tallinn, St. Petersburg and Helsinki.  Because we enjoyed our cruise-offered excursions in Cuba, we opted to pre-book RC shore excursions for this cruise.  Unfortunately, our Stockholm tour was cancelled, so we ended up doing an ""on your own"" tour visiting a few of the main sites including Gamla Stan (old town) and City Hall.  Our Tallinn excursion was a ""Best of"" with primary focus in the Old Town area, including a lunch at a Medieval restaurant.  In St. Petersburg, we took the ""Grand St. Petersburg"" tour which included a visit to the Hermitage, Church of Spilled Blood, St. Isaacs Cathedral and lunch at a Russian restaurant.  Finally, in Helsinki, we took a tour that combined Porvoo and Helsinki, which also included lunch at a gorgeous farm manor house.  Aside from our botched Stockholm plan, all of the RC excursions were top notch, and we felt the prices were extremely fair for all that we got to see and experience.  We also stayed in Copenhagen a day before and a day after, but we did not partake in any RC tour offerings for that city.The Baltic Sea itinerary was truly amazing!  And, if you're like me and don't enjoy even the slightest rough seas, sailing on the Baltic Sea was like glass the entire time.  We didn't even realize the ship was moving at times, to be honest!  I came prepared with various motion sickness remedies and didn't even use them on this trip.  With the Baltic Sea being a smaller body of water, we got to sail a little closer to land (Sweden was especially scenic), and also saw many ships sailing with us in various directions.We'd love to take this cruise itinerary again someday, but there is so much of the world to see!  Overall, we had a great time on the Serenade of the Seas.  It will certainly be one of our more memorable vacation experiences, but that is mostly due to the itinerary of the trip.",Sail Date: May 2019|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Europe|,"Phoenix, Arizona"

I took this on a 7-night Baltic cruise in August 2018. Best cruise I have been on. The stops are great in Stockholm, Talin, St. Pete, and Helsinki with leaving from Copenhagen. Make sure to spend at least 3-days in Copenhagen too. St. Pete you could use a lot more time in, a longer cruise with an overnight there would be better. The ship seems modern, spacious, and a splash of more luxury compared to the newer massive ships. The rooms are standard just like any other. It is just nice actually being on a ship and feeling like you are on one. The food on the smaller ships tends to be better, but this is especially true when leaving from Europe. The food in the main dinning room, the buffet and especially Giovanni's Table were excellent. Giovanni's Table for the second time on a different ship was extraordinary for the price.

This ship is mid-sized and was refurbished not long ago. Itinerary from Ft Lauderdale: St Thomas, St Croix, Antigua, St Kitts, St Maarten. Inside storeroom was adequate with enough space for 2. Nothing special.Windjammer Cafe was typical buffet food. Some items were good, others - like French toast which was under a heat lamp - were not a good option as it dried out and became hard. Breakfast they had an omelette bar and a fried eggs station. Main dining - better food, very good service. Decent menu deletion. Salmon one night, lobster, tiger prawns, steak etc. Most of the meals were good. Lobster was a letdown - very little flavor. I imagine they cooked hundreds together in a big vat and had em in the water too long.Chops specialty restaurant - top notch. Too bad it's an upcharge.Main stage entertainment: hit and miss. First comedian bombed - jokes fell flat. He did a late adult show as well and bombed again. Hypnotist - didn't care for his show. Magician who was great - told better jokes than the first comedian. Savannah Jack rock band - very good music. And on last night another comic who was very funny. Along with these shows we had the typical ""newlywed"" type game which we skipped. Rest of the nights were RCCL singers and dancers. Mixed bag here. The 2 male singers were average at best, and neither had the range needed for some songs. Entertainment around ship was good. Solo guitar, solo piano, big band, a rock band. The rock band was too loud and not great. Ship also has a water slide, climbing wall, movie theatre etc. Always something to do.Ports: St Thomas and Antigua were great. St Croix was boring. St Kitts was pretty nice but does not have very good beaches. St Maarten - we wanted to go to the French side for better beaches but there was a strike on by the French unions, so we stayed Dutch side. Ok but not great.Note on excursions: cruise lines overprice what they offer. If you have been to these islands before you can save 50% or more just going ashore and booking. That's what we did.

This added we were told to a very long line to check-in.The balcony room was great, lots of space, a few limits as far as power points near the bed, as I use a CPAP machine, but the crew ran a long extension cord that worked.The cruise was wonderful, good to great food, good service all the time, our crew helped at any and every time, the scenery was wonderful, with the ship going deep into the fiords.Shore excursions were good and well organized.The ship was or seemed to be in good condition, we really had nothing to compare it to, but other people that we met veteran, cruisers said it seemed in good condition.",Sail Date: August 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: South Pacific|,Sydney

DO NOT GO!,"This was our 6th cruise but our first with Royal Caribbean.  Safe to say we're never going to use them again.  Every aspect of the trip was uninspiring.  Previous cruises we've been on we've always discovered something new and gotten off thinking it was such a great holiday.From day one, even before we'd boarded we were let down.  Prior to cruising we received multiple emails about an annual Australian Maritime inspection.  This was going to delay our boarding until after 2:30pm.  When we turned up at that time all photo opportunities had been packed up and we discovered luggage and people everywhere on board already.  My sea pass card was also inactive as i got on the ship.  I was made to wait 30 minutes while a new one was brought to me.  Once on board the service from bar areas initially were not impressive.  Staff were abrupt and rude (with the exception of a certain few for the entire cruise who were amazing - special mention to George and Rex in the Pool Bar, Ronny and Francisco in the Casino Bar and Avis Athina and Made Wibawa our dining room staff)  Little things like having to pay for Lanyards.  We provide such things to clients in my business and a bag of 500 the cost is 12c each.  A small thing for a cruise of 2000.  Yet just another money making opportunity.Speaking of money i was absolutely aghast to find out 3 days in that all purchases and account balances (including some casino trips) were in US dollars.  Having paid for our cruise directly through Royal Caribbean website as well as the drinks package in AUD we had no idea that everything on board was in USD.  By day 3 a $700 account was actually $1200  The good deal on shopping we thought we were getting just became worse than retail.The food in comparison to Carnival and P&O was a level below, taste and variety did not match previous cruises.  Also the lack of late night eateries was crap.  My wife and i when cruising enjoy late evenings, sometimes until Casino close and not having food facilities this late was annoying.One pro for the trip i could recommend would be the drinks package.  Both my wife and i enjoy a drink but normally we wouldn't find ourselves spending that much.  However the variety of cocktails and alcohols was fantastic and even more so once we realised the advertised prices were US dollars it was even more value.That was a further  reason the US dollars on board was unexpected.  The drinks prices seemed expensive even for AUD.  In USD they are simply over the top.",Sail Date: November 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: |Destination: Australia|,

I went on the same cruise (South to North) in 2012, and again (North to South) in 2019.   Alaska is amazing, it is full of vistas that you just can't believe until you see them.  Every port has amazing mountains, waterfalls, and wildlife.   It is a place like no other that I've been.  While this ship is a bit outdated, and small, if it's your opportunity to see Alaska, it's worth every penny!While the ship has been remodeled between my first and last trip on it, I can't say that any one aspect of the ship stood out as being ""new"" or ""remodeled"" to me.  I want to emphasize that there was nothing wrong with the ship, or anything that needed to be ""fixed"" with it.  The staff on the ship was amazing, as is almost every Royal Caribbean ship that I have sailed on.  Each one does a good job at doing everything they can to make your trip as good as it could be. While in Alaska, the pool deck didn't get used as much as if this was in a tropical environment of course.  However, more times than not, the hot tubs were full, and it was difficult to get a seat in them, unless you enjoyed really wedging yourself in between strangers. Activities on the ship weren't as abundant as a lot of the other ships that I have sailed on either.  There was enough to keep you entertained, but rarely did my wife and I have trouble picking between two activities.   We were also disappointed that there wasn't a show in the main stage every night.  We found that it was a good thing that we purchased the alcohol package as we found ourselves just hanging out in a bar most nights chatting through the evening.  The cabins are standard cruise cabins, I would imagine the exact same ones as the new ships have on them even.  They were of a normal cruise cabin size with a lack of outlets and tiny bathrooms.  This isn't a negative of this ship, just ships in general.  My wife and I found the food on this ship to be average.  We ate in the main dining room every night except for one night we were in Givanoni's for the Murder Mystery Theater show.  The for was pretty standard for the MDR on Royal Caribbean lately.  The menu seemed to have some of the exact same options as our Caribbean cruise the previous October. Much like the rest of the ship, I would rate the food as good, but nothing to write home about, nothing negative to say about it either.  Overall, my personal preference tends to larger, more modern ships.  I personally would hesitate to take this ship on a trip other than Alaska.  The ship didn't have anything so outstanding that it would make me want to take it elsewhere.  If you are a fan of the smaller ships, and don't need all of the activities, you may find this ship what you are looking for.",Sail Date: June 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: |Destination: Alaska|,"Louisville, Kentucky"

We will NEVER cruise with Royal Caribbean again.  Our friends wife had breathing problems from time she entered cabin.  Next morning rug was wet, and she complained.  They set up fan to dry it.  Next morning same thing, but wetter. As well as water seeping up thru tile joins in bathroom.  they offered her an inside cabin replacement, but She had paid for Premium balcony suite.  After complained all day they finally gave her an inside cabin for the afternoon while they ripped up and replaced the tile in bathroom and all the carpeting in the room.  When they ripped up carpet the under pad was green with mold.  Same when they ripped up tile in bathroom...green old everywhere.  No wonder she had problems. She had to visit ship doctor 4 times for relief with breathing.  Bill for doctor was over $800, plus meds.  Ship gave her credit for the $800 but not for the meds.  Over next few days I observed crew replacing carpet in hallways.  in every place they ripped up carpet the under pad and the floor under was GREEN with MOLD. Many people were coughing throughout the cruise, including ourselves. I'm sure the ships atmosphere contributed to this.  Many of our friends visited the ships doctor for meds to help with coughing.  Even after we left the ship in Sydney it took us two weeks to stop coughing and feel up to par again. Food was average, 5 or 6 expensive alternative restaurants were expensive. Internet fee was ridiculous...would have been over $20 PER DAY for internet access.     Soda package was $15 PER DAY.  For just soda.   Very limited library with many books in foreign languages and not sorted on shelves.  Didn't seem to be any crew member responsible for library.   My wife plays bridge, it was set up daily IN THE DINING  ROOM on large round tables.  Not on card tables or in quiet area like the conference rooms.  On a few tables in the games area.  Library and card games area opened onto the atrium, or centre of the ship were there was constant LOUD music and noise group games like trivia.  Usually these games are in separate rooms but not on this ship.  Seating around atrium was very limited for those who wanted to listen to that music.  Entertainment in large Theatre at front of ship was uniformly SO LOUD and the lighting very unprofessional.  Singers stepping to the front area of stage were in shadow, and you couldn't see their faces.  Can't believe this continued even after I made complaint about poor stage lighting.   Visiting lecturers were given this theatre to use, not a smaller venue.   Was very difficult to find a quiet area on the ship to just sit and read. Movie Theater was small and left in almost total darkness up to 5 minutes before movie started.  They kept playing the same 5 or 6 movies for the whole cruise. All in all a very unsatisfactory 19 day cruise.

The bed was lumpy and uncomfortable and the second failure was the shower head that was blocked with calcium and spluttered out water for the whole 9 nights.My Husband and I paid for The ultimate dining and ultimate beverage package and enjoyed the ability to eat or drink where and when we chose to without having to worry about the cost at the end of the cruise.The specialty restaurants were all very good with Chops being the standout.On the few occasions that we ate at the main dining restaurant the food was ordinary and the wait for delivery was long.One evening I wore a necklace and placed my keycard on the chain, I gave the waiter my keycard at Samba Grill and when it was returned it was missing a rather large opal. The manager called me to apologise and guest services offered me a $10.95 lanyard for free, on departure we were charged for the lanyard $10.95.The ship has a Karaoke competition that was most enjoyable until the end when the winner got a pen a highlighter a cheap metal medal, water bottle and a cheap backpack.

I did not like the fact that in the buffet dinning room there were no place settings on the tables, you had to pick up your own napkin and silverware along with your food.  I have been on other cruise lines and the tables were always set. However, I could overlook this little problem but the one fact that I did not like was the expectation that I would also pick up my own coffee. There were no cups on the table and no cream or sugar. I found this very annoying and it may only be because I had not had my first cup of coffee for the day but also because on other cruises I have been on someone was at your table as soon as you sat down to offer coffee. Finally, on the second day of the cruise I called over a staff person who was busing tables and asked for coffee and cream and sugar which they got for me. I was not the only person who did this. On about the 3rd or 4th morning of my cruise a waiter went by with a cart with coffee and cream and sugar. The other problem I had with this cruise was that there were no lectures provided on Alaska or any of the ports we would be visiting. I was quite disappointed with this lack of attention to a teaching opportunity and have enjoyed these types of lectures on my cruises to Panama Canal and to Hawaii. (with 2 different cruise companies)That is my criticism that keeps my overall review at average. Other than that I really liked this cruise. Radiance of the Seas is not a large ship but has all the things you need to enjoy a cruise. Bars, optional restaurants, casino, library, games room, pool, hot tub, rock climbing, basketball court, disco and shopping. Our meals in both the buffet dinning room and the main dinning room were quite good. I was very pleased with the service from our waiter and his assistant in the main dinning room as well as where we were seated in the main dinning room. There were 9 of us. I appreciated the ease of boarding on the day of departure. I have to say of all the cruises I have been on this was the fastest and easiest boarding. I am not sure what was different from other cruise lines. I also appreciated how easy it was leaving the ship in the various ports of call and returning to the ship.Our cabin steward was friendly and helpful as were the other servers we met in the various bars. Their helpfulness and friendliness helps to make for an enjoyable vacation. My cabin was no bigger or smaller than other cruise ships and the bed was quite comfortable.The Captain was quite good about keeping us informed on things everyday such as weather, arrival times. Our cruise also included a land portion tour of Alaska and was very nicely organized by Royal Caribbean.  We left from Vancouver, Canada which is a lovely place to visit. Our first port of call was KetchiKan where we did a tour of Eagles, Totems and Lighthouse. I quite liked this tour and it would have been exceptional if the weather had been nicer. We saw lots of eagles and the scenery in the area was beautiful.Our next port of call was Icy Straight Point, this is a privately owned tourist destination. It is owned by the Huna Totem Corporation and was a very interesting stop, both in offering some nice vistas but also to provide information about the Tlingit people.Our 3rd port was Juneau which I found interesting because it is a capital city that can only be reached by water or air.Our 4th stop was Skagway. We took the White Pass rail tour which was great. Our 5th stop was not a port but the Hubbard Glacier. This was fantastic and well worth the cost of the cruise. During all our cruising I should say that we were cruising the inside passage and this offered some interesting views as well. There is nothing dull about a cruise to Alaska.We disembarked in Seward which has a very nice aquarium. From here we boarded a bus that took us on our land portion tour. We were headed for Denali National Park. I really liked the land portion and liked Denali National park. We saw lots of wildlife and the park is so different from any other national park I have been to. We also got close to Mount Denali. That was also a very special moment on the tour.

Many activities to choose from on the ship Enjoyed each port. Bought 1 excursion through RC and it was fun (zodiac boats in Icy Strait- saw orca whales, it was amazing!!). Food was OK in both dining room and buffet. Bought the refreshment package- loved the mocktail pina coladas, the fresh squeezed OJ, and iced coffee. Bottles water before excursions was nice too. Recommend every goes to Alaska at least once! I hear next year a RC ship will go round trip from Vancouver, so airfare will be cheaper than one ways to Anchorage and home from Vancouver like we did, yet all the ports are in Alaska (vs. one stop being Victoria, BC when going round trip from Seattle- Victoria is beautiful but I'm paying to see Alaska!).

Customer service desk might need a new location. Right next to nightly entertainment area (blaring music/singing/game show type things) makes it hard to communicate. When booking excursions, know that All-Aboard times are 30 minutes prior to published departure time. Ship could use updating but room was good and room attendant was awesome!

There was a lot of entertainment, and the overall experience was organized and well-orchestrated. The meals were quite good (better than expected) both in the buffet and the sit-down dining room. At times the sit-down experience was a little too slow, esp. for families like us who were traveling with small kids. Crew members were helpful and courteous, though. We enjoyed the art gallery. The outdoor (kid) pools were too cold, in my opinion - I wish all pools could be like the adult solarium pool, which is lovely. My kids enjoyed rock climbing and miniature golf. We all loved karaoke and some dancing. The magic show was great. We had a ""spacious balcony room"" for 5 of us, and it was bigger and offered more storage space than we expected. Obviously it's not going to be huge (and will feel small compared to your average hotel room), but it felt pretty comfortable for us most of the time. Kids about 7-8 and up are probably reasonably safe to do some exploration of the boat with children their own age and up. We used the kids club somewhat minimally, but when we did, our 10- and 7-year-old daughters enjoyed it. Our 5-year-old daughter was a little too young for this cruise - the long meals and the shows got pretty boring for her. We appreciated some very good service, but we were taken off guard when an automatic gratuity charge of about $75/day appeared on our check-out bill. This was in addition to the 18% gratuity that was automatically charged for all ""extra"" services - like purchasing a cocktail, getting a spa service, etc. None of the 15 of us recalled having been told about this daily gratuity fee, although one branch of the family had experienced it on another RC cruise. When we inquired at member services, we were given to understand that the crew depend on tips to achieve a fair and reasonable salary. We didn't like this, and it made us wonder whether fair labor practices are occuring. Admittedly we hadn't cruised on a large ship in many years, but in our prior experience, gratuity was entirely at one's own discretion. You are allowed to refuse to pay the daily gratuity - but I think most people would feel guilty doing so with the way this is set up, esp. once you've gotten to know crew members over the week! So if you're considering this cruise, you should add this amount into your estimated cost (approx $15 per person, including children, per day). RC did a good job moving such a large number of people. At times, though, you should expect lines, e.g., for the elevator. The ship is in good condition, though, and really there are a ton of activities. We slept well, too - it was quiet and dark.In terms of the ports, we really liked Ketchikan, Juneau, and Skagway. Icy Straight Point was not a valuable stop for us on any level, though. We got wind (and to be fair I did not confirm this) that Royal Caribbean developed Icy Straight Point as a money tree. We weren't interested in doing a ropes course for like $150/person or a 90-second zip line for $130/person. We walked into town, which is a very long, hot walk to an economically depressed area. Our favorite excursion was sled dogs/gold-panning in Skagway. Meeting Iditarod racers and dogs was extremely memorable for us (and the puppies are unbelievably cute). We also enjoyed the whale watching excursion in Juneau, and we indeed saw many whales, porpoises, seals, bald eagles, and sea lions.

You can buy different drink packages ranging from about $12-$70/day per person. If you don't, you can have water, tea, lemonade, or coffee.  When disembarking on land excursions, there was a cruise employee offering  bottles of water......but only if you paid extra for that package.  When we were viewing Hubbard Glacier from the stern of the ship it was very chilly outside and a server came around with hot chocolate..........only for passengers who bought the refreshment package for $29/day/person.  We chose not to pay these exorbitant prices, and we ended up feeling like have-nots.  A person can still buy drinks per item, and my husband paid $56 for four drinks (including the mandatory 18% gratuity).  We bought our own wine on board for the above reasons, and sometimes had difficulty getting wine glasses from the bartenders because they were afraid they would run out.Food in the Windjammer cafe and Cascades dining room was mediocre at best; service in the dining room was slow.  The dining room employees were always working very hard, so my guess is that food services was not well run.  I was told by another passenger the specialty restaurants (for an extra charge) were not very good.  There was a speaker on how to get a flatter stomach, but he turned out to be selling his product, so it was really a sales pitch.The onboard entertainment was so-so, nothing great.The exercise room was ok, but some of the machines were broken and the doors to the outside of the ship were often broken.There is nothing state-of-the-art about the ship, except the prices.  All of the servers and room attendants were very friendly and helpful.  They work 7 days/week and many hours a day.  My understanding is their wages are not that high compared to American standards.  This means the thousands of dollars we spent are mainly going to the upper echelon employees and not to those doing the hard work.If you call Royal Caribbean customer service, be prepared for a different answer every time.  Royal Caribbean did not communicate logistics of the land portion of our tour very well ahead of time.  Every time I called to ask a question, I got vastly different answers.  So Royal Caribbean is not spending money training and communicating with its customer service reps.Finally, part of our package included a transfer from the airport to hotel on the 1st night of our trip.  I called and gave Royal Caribbean our flight info (several times in order to get to someone who understood what I was talking about), and called and confirmed the transfer the day of our flight.  Even so, my husband and I were stranded at the airport at 11:45pm as no one showed to pick us up.  When I asked the tour director, she was apologetic and called the company to see if we could be comped and was told no - we were listed as a no-show at the airport.  Impossible.  We looked all over baggage claim both inside and outside, and there was no one holding up a sign and no van that indicated it was part of a tour company.  Our belief is that the driver didn't want to be at the airport at that late hour and didn't show, but claimed they were there.  It would have cost the company nothing to comp us a couple of drinks, but they didn't.Again, cheap, cheap, cheap!",Sail Date: July 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: Family (multi-generational)|Destination: Alaska|,

We can say the cruise went exceptionally well, we were blessed with fabulous weather throughout. The first 2 port stops were just ok but after them the rest of the stops were absolutely wonderful and highly recommended, the hubbard glacier was just amazingly beautiful the highlight of the cruise. Some of the port stops are just full of jewelry shops selling Tanzanite ( a Tanzanian blue stone, what the heck, we are in Alaska).The ship itself is very clean, we thought a bit outdated in the decor but still a very impressive elegant ship inside and out. The staff are fabulous and treat you very well, out of all the hundreds of staff we just ran across a couple that were not as friendly but you would expect this, but nothing to worry about. The captain of the ship was very interactive and he was a standout even singing for the passengers, he was definitely an asset for Royal Caribbean. The food was very very nice and no complaints at all, we even had juicy lobster for dinner. One downfall the food was closed down around 1am, which would effect late eaters. lol. We opt for the drink package and did not regret as we did get value for our money. The entertainment on the ship was ok but could do with a bit more, saying this we had a couple of great nights of live entertainment and fun.Majority of the passengers were very friendly.Our points and recommendations you should consider if you are going to do the same Alaskan cruise:Buy a drink package for unlimited alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks.By a minimum of a 2 night Dinner package to dine in the specialty restaurants.We also bought the Key which lets you skip the lines when you embark and disembark, gives you lunch in a specialty restaurant when you first get on board and a full served breakfast on your last day, plus internet access on the whole voyage and a few other perks.Make sure you book in the traditional eating facility for no extra cost when you purchase your ticket, this is where you have your dinner on a serviced table booked for you at your requested time.We bought some shore excursions online and some on board the ship, you can also buy some at the port of call. All vary in priceTry and do the dog snow sledding in Skagway on the glacier as we heard it was unbelievable. we regret we didn't do it, but it is a bit pricey.Do the whale watching in Juneau guaranteed to see them, we also saw Orcas on the day. The ship finally docks in Seward, we got a tour from there to Anchorage with the addition of taking us to a wildlife park on the way which you will see most of Alaska's wildlife. Worth doing.To sum it all up, we would not hesitate to recommend the Radiance of the Seas (Royal Caribbean) and it's cruise to wonderful Alaska, we will cruise with them definitely again and hopefully they can deliver the next cruise to the same standard as the Alaskan cruise.",Sail Date: June 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Alaska|,"Melbourne, Australia"

Last summer 17 members of my immediate family signed up to go on the RC Alaskan cruise. An additional member, my sister’s partner, wanted to join about a month prior to departure but was not able to join on the first day because of school exams. Before purchasing the additional ticket, my mother called Royal Caribbean to ask if it was possible for said additional member to be able to join at the second port. She was SPECIFICALLY told that it WAS possible by contacting the ETT (emergency travel team) on the day of departure to let them know that two guests will not arrive on time to board in Vancouver and the ETT team will organize a way for them to board on the next port in Ketchikan, Alaska. The RC representative even went as far as offering to book the flights for my sister and her partner to get to the second port in Alaska. A month later, the day of the cruise’s departure, we followed the RC rep’s instructions perfectly only to find out that there is actually a law preventing anyone from boarding the ship anywhere except the initial port.WE WERE MISINFORMED AND ROYAL CARIBBEAN REFUSES TO REIMBURSE OUR $5,700 USD THAT IT COST FOR THE ROOM FOR THE 2 GUESTS WHO WERE UNABLE TO JOIN.

Now that our kids are adults, we decided to do the Alaska cruisetour for our 30th anniversary, even though we went a bit after our 31st.Some comments:-  The ship needs some work.  The carpets are old and dirty.  There was a rip in the curtain of our balcony stateroom.  The ship is in serious need of a paint job, inside and out.-  We were underwhelmed by the service.  One morning, our breakfast was so slow coming out that we had to leave on an excursion before it was all served.  On our first night out, I asked for a Mojito but was told they couldn't make if for me because, ""This bar [the one in the dining room] doesn't have mint.""  Get some mint from one of the other bars!  That having been said, they did comp us one dinner at Giovanni's Table, where the food was very good.-  While we're not vegetarians, we only eat kosher meat, so all of the meat and seafood (not fish) options were out.  There was a lot of salad, and there were about 5 vegetarian options on the buffet, but the majority were Indian dishes and were spicy.-  The excursions were fantastic.  We did:    *  The Taku Lodge and Floatplane excursion and saw a couple of black bears up close, like within 20'    *  The wildlife search at Icy Straight.    *  The Musher's Camp at Skagway.  Got to hold three week old Husky mix puppies!-  Our room steward, Everton, was wonderful.-  We did two couples massages. Expensive, but worth it.  A muscle knot in my left shoulder that I've had for literally two years is gone.-  We also took the land tour first, up to Denali, back to Talkeetna and back to Anchorage and Seward.  Our tour director, Jason, was really great.  Accommodations in Denali were ""eh"" - very cramped, but it was only one night, but the accommodations in Talkeetna were beautiful.  If you're going to take the land trip, do it before the cruise.  It's a lot of running, so doing it before the cruise gives you time to relax.-  We met a few really nice couples and exchanged email addresses so that we can keep in touch.We extended our stay in Vancouver by a few days and are enjoying it here.",Sail Date: May 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Alaska|,"Brooklyn, New York"

The same movies that are played in the public venues for free. We had traveled on Radiance before, but the ship had been refurbished since then  and seemed very crowded and 'stuffed to the gills'. The diamond lounge was always overcrowded and we could not get a seat.  We made the mistake of booking the aft balcony cabin directly below the Windjammer outdoor eating area and heard the chairs scoot across the floor all hours of the day and NIGHT!  Not much sleep in our room.  We could easily hear our neighbors talking and THEIR alarm woke us every morning at 7:00!  The cruise staff seemed very tired of their jobs and had difficulty engaging the guests to participate in activities.

Long queues that wound from one end of the ship to another with the staff totally oblivious to passenger's discomfort!  Disembarking at Honolulu was absolute chaos that took more than 2 hours!2)  Forced tipping charges outrageous!  Be careful when you get on board Royal Caribbean (and some other cruise lines) to make sure your credit card is not charged the exorbitant US$24-odd per day per person for a forced tipping charge!  This can mount up to more than $700 on a 3 week cruise which is totally unacceptable!  For God's sake, Royal Caribbean, pay your staff a decent wage - it is NOT our responsibility to fork out a lot of money for a cruise then have to subsidise your staff in order to get a decent wage!  This is a real problem with a lot of cruises that depart from the USA.  We are generous tippers to our cabin and table staff but feel that forced daily tipping charges are absolutely unreasonable and we strongly doubt that most of these charges find their way into the pockets of staff anyway.  3)  Not enough seating on board the ship.  Everywhere you went on Radiance of the Seas, especially the overcrowded horror of the Windjammer Buffet, one just about had to rugby tackle someone to get a seat!  If you wanted to get a seat in the tiny area of the Schooners Bar to play trivia, you had to get there about an hour earlier in order to find a seat!  The ONLY place one could find a seat comfortably was the larger Colony Club where we were asked to move because they had some unpopular Art Auction there selling off tawdry artwork that noone (with any taste) would purchase anyway!4)  The food was less than mediocre.  Unlike other big cruise ships like Carnival, Azamara or the Princess lines, ""Radiance of the Seas"" NEVER changes its menu from one day to the next (except for a couple of minor changes).  The food choice was boring and often served tepid or cold.  The cost of drinks is exorbitant compared to Carnival, P&O or Princess lines;5)  No ""fluid"" dining arrangements on offer.  Unlike Carnival (and many other lines), there are no ""fluid"" dining arrangements offered on the Radiance of the Seas which means you are literally ""stuck"" at the same table at the same time for every evening meal!  This means that you don't get to meet a variety of passengers for dinner nor can you eat at a time that suits you.  We found this very inhibiting and restrictive;6)  Showers were tiny!  My husband and I are not big people and there were plenty of them on board.  How they managed in the tiny shoe boxes Royal Caribbean call showers, is beyond me!7)  Some members of staff were rude and did not provide good service.  There were areas of the ship, eg the hot dog bar, where the service staff let you stand there for ages and totally ignored you.  I must mention that this does NOT include our cabin staff (Hamden) who was absolutely outstanding and offered efficient, professional and friendly service.  We spoke to passengers who felt that some of the table staff need to be trained not to keep interrupting passengers at the table when the passengers are in mid-conversation - they found this intrusive;8)  Cost of excursions outrageously over-priced.  Be warned NOT to take any on-board excursions which range from $150 to more than $200 per person for a 3 hour excursion!  Our advice is to wait till you get off the ship and secure a local guide to take you to the destination(s) of your choice.  It is far better to give your money to the locals - and help their economy - instead of forking out an obscene amount of money to Royal Caribbean.  The local travel guides are there at each port waiting for you and offer the EXACT same tours for a fraction of the price and get you back to the ship in plenty of time before it sails.  The local travel guides know all about the type of excursions the ship offer.  We did local tours from Wellington and Picton (in NZ), Tahiti, Moorea and Bora Bora and they were all outstanding, ventured further than the excursions offered by the ship and were literally 4 times less expensive!9)  Radiance of the Seas charge for EVERYTHING!  Once on board this ship, you are a ""captured audience"".  Unlike Carnival, Norwegian Star and other ships, Royal Caribbean charge for fresh, clean water which, we think, is absolutely intolerable.  Many people do not want to risk a stomach bug by drinking the water out of the tap at the sink of a cruising ship and water is absolutely ESSENTIAL for life!  Passengers need water to drink, to take their medication and to rehydrate themselves on a hot day.  There is nowhere one can fill a water bottle unless you are prepared to keep filling up cups to take down to the cabin!  Royal Caribbean charge around US$3 for a small bottle of fresh water which cost can mount up over the course of a cruise.  This is one aspect of the cruise that enfuriated a lot of passengers that we spoke to.    10)  In addition, everywhere passengers go on the Radiance of the Seas, they are constantly ""harassed"" by people trying to flog things!  You are bombarded by intrusive photographers trying to take your photos (for a fee);  constant messages inciting you to gamble at the casino;  non-stop reminders to purchase over-priced jewelry and cosmetics at the countless stores throughout the ship.  It became exhausting trying to dodge what can only be described as a veritable ARMY of staff trying to sell something.11)  Entertainment was mediocre.  Unlike Carnival or the Azamara, the entertainment on board the Radiance of the Seas was absolutely mediocre.  They only had two musicals during the whole 3 weeks duration of the cruise and these were not professionally presented.  12)  Radiance of the Seas does NOT cater for children.  This is a ship that has a very old demographic of (mostly) retired people from Florida!  This is a sad aspect of cruising with Royal Caribbean.  Personally, we often cruise with our adult children and grandchildren and love a ship that has a wide range of ages on board - young children and teenagers give a cruise a ""vibrancy"" and energy that, alas, thousands of elderly people do not  :(    This is a ship that does NOT cater well to children in the way Carnival does.  There were a few children on board but nothing much to keep them amused although there was a Children's Club on-board but not much else.  If you have children, stick with Carnival or the Princess lines which have so much for children and teenagers.LIFT YOUR GAME, RADIANCE OF THE SEAS .....  our experience on your second-rate ship has ensured that we will NEVER cruise with Royal Caribbean again.",Sail Date: May 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Hawaii|,

Can recommend Carolyn from Customised Tours for a thoroughly professional and personlised look at the Thermal regions - There were 4 of us in our group, and we enjoyed the trip to the Maori grounds, seeing the geysers, the craft school and the the traditional welcome. She was at the port to pick us up at the gate, settled us into a very comfortable mini-bus and then took us off on an informative tour of the area, including new housing estates, a Kiwi Fruit farm, spectacular views, on the way to Rotarua, then after lunch overlooking the thermal gounds, returned to the ship showing us the amazing sights such as steam rising from the ground throughout the parks and some homes, showing some buildings damaged by recent earthquakes - so sad - and out to a Redwood Forest for a walk - and all too soon - back to our home away from home - The Radiance of the Seas. Her local knowledge showed through - she beat every other bus to the venues, always had a fresh, dry umbrella, for our walks, provided water, commentary and a cheerful disposition. Then we went on to Akaroa - our friends were booked on the TransAlpine train trip to Arthurs Pass - we wanted to go on to Christchurch - for a revisit.They had a great time - so did we - but a lot sadder.Took a bus from the port, and it was a wonderful drive through the mountain regions, with views back to the harbour - the Radiance looked like a toy in a bath tub. On arrival in Christchurch, we were dropped at the Museum, that we enjoyed - a marvellous venue - the displays were quite incredible, and informative staff, and a great coffee shop with views over Hagley Park.Then it was time to take the walk up to the Christchurch Cathedral. You could see the building - dominated by a large black hole all the way up the avenue. By the time we got there I was in tears - not just for building, but for all the people of Christchurch and our memories of happier times. The newer buildings around Cathedral Square are popping up everywher - but the tragedy of what has been lost - and may never be regained - is there for everyone to see. We then walked back past the Avon River and then back down to the Museum to wait for our pickup and return 'Home'. For those who haven't ventured on a cruise - I can highly recommend that you try it - you are so well looked after. The Cabin and Restaurant staff look after everyone so well. Nothing ever seems a problem. We do not take a 'Drinks Package' but pay for any liquor as we go - but do think that a glass of wine could be included as part of the evening menu. They are many who do abuse the idea of a Drink Package - and I won't subsidise drunks.After Akaroa we had to go back to Wellington, through the Cook Strait and were to go to Picton - but we couldn't get in there either - so for the next few days we were basically headed back to Sydney. We catch a train to Circular Quay and walk up to the ship - and do the reverse going back to our real home. Sad to leave the ship - The Radiance is one of the older ships of the Royal Carribean line - and needs a bit of R & M - but she is so elegant and not as large as some.You make a lot of your own fun on a cruise - unless you want to be involved inn a conga line of arranged activities - it is all up to you.",Sail Date: March 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Friends|Destination: South Pacific|,"Blue Mountains, Australia"

We have many things that could have been very negative happen while we were on this trip.  There was a medivac situation that made us late to our next port.  The Captain did everything he could to catch up some time.  When it was apparent that would not happen, Princess did a great job rescheduling our excursion.  When we were supposed to return to Ft Lauderdale on March 8, the CDC would not let our ship dock until 2 crew members where tested for the Coronavirus.  The Captain kept us as informed as he could all day long.  The crew provided the same great service we had all week - food, drinks, entertainment, etc.  When we finally docked, there was another medical issue that had to be taken care of before we could disembark.  We ended up disembarking approximately 15 hours late.  The Princess crew did their best to get us off the ship as quickly as possible.  I just want to give major Kudos to Princess and their crew for the way they handled all those situations.For the cruise itself...This was our third cruise with Princess. The other 2 times we cruised on the Ruby Princess.  I do not think the food was as good on the Regal Princess.  However, it was not terrible.  They did have the pistachio pudding in the International café on multiple days.  As always, it was delicious.Our cabin steward, Chris Asia, was wonderful!  He took great care of us and always made sure that our cabin was in good order.  He was friendly every time we interacted with him.  He helped get our tv working each time it had issues, even 3 times in one night and he never seemed bothered by the request.Our wait staff was AMAZING!!!  Vlatko is funny, quick witted, friendly, hard-working and a great waiter.  It was such a pleasure having him serve us each night, so much so that we searched for him the extra day we were on the ship so that we could again sit in his serving section (Even though they had moved him from where he served all week long).  His Jr. waiter was Diana.  She was friendly and so good at playing along with all of Vlatko's crazy stories, such as Diana having to catch the cow for our steaks, or having to dive off the ship to get our scallops.  She also is a hard-worker.  One night when Diana was not feeling well, we had Jeffrey as the Jr. Waiter.  We didn't see him much, but he seemed friendly.The steel drum class was so much fun!

This was my 20th cruise and 7th with Princess. It had been about 10 years since sailing with Princess and since their prices are higher I thought maybe they still offered a greater product but that was not the case.  My deluxe balcony cabin was very tiny and the ""mini suites"" on my deck (15) where the size of a regular balcony cabin on other Princess ships and other lines.  They have added a lot of interior cabins so they had to decrease the size of the exterior cabins.  There is no promenade on this ship which was a surprise and although there is a jogging track at the back of the ship on the top deck, it's not quite the same. The food was good throughout the ship, but of lesser quality than in the past. I really missed the soufles that princess used to be known for.  The grand chocolate buffet that was always fun to check out has also gone away. But the various fish and seafood dishes were all very good and the pizza in Alfredos was also a delight. I'm not one to nit pick over things so I won't but the ship is just not as beautiful as many others. It's perfectly adequate, just nothing special.  I felt as though you could see where costs where cut everywhere.  It's a mass produced cruise ship, clearly the product of Carnival. A highlight and one huge plus on this ship were the production shows onboard. Great cast with amazing energy put on some impressive shows.  Some of the best I've seen on any ship. The staff gets mixed reviews. For the first half of the cruise the staff was quite unfriendly and surprisingly downright rude in some cases. It was very apparent that they were just going through the motions. We walked up to a bar on the 2nd night and we couldn't tell if the bartender was closing down or just tidying up so we went over. She looked right at us, didn't say a word, and kept doing what she was doing. We stood there for a couple minutes, all the while she said absolutely nothing. Not,"" hi, I'm closing down"" or anything.  But yet looked right at us several times. So incredibly rude.  In the dining room the waiter asked for our drink order. There were 3 of us at the table. 2 of us gave our drink order and just as the 3rd was ready to say what they wanted, the waiter turned around and just walked away.  It was so strange, I've never experienced anything like that.  The second half of the cruise the staff seemed a little better and there were some very friendly and helpful members.All in all I had a great time, as I always do, but for our tiny ""deluxe"" balcony cabin the price we paid was way too much. My advice, wait for a really good sale.",Sail Date: February 2020|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Friends|Destination: Caribbean|,"Portland, Maine"

Namely, take a cruise.  We had planned to do it for our 30th wedding anniversary, but thanks  to a wonderful present from my father, we were able to do so earlier than we had expected.The Regal Princess in one of the newer ships of the Princess line, built in 2015, and is one of the first to use ""medallion"" technology which replaces the cruise card that most cruisers are more than acquainted.  The small electronic device which can be fitted to a wrist band, landyard, necklace etc., opens your cabin door on approach, handles your day to day on board charges, and stores your personal information from your passport for boarding and disembarkation.  I found it really easy and it now feels a little strange not to be wearing it and handing cash to people for services.My wife and I shared an inside cabin at 175 sq feet, which to myself and I'm sure most folks new to cruises sounds tiny, but the space is well used.  The room can be set as two twin beds or a converted queen, has a desk with chair and a wall mounted television, plenty of closet and shelf space.  The shower and toilet/vanity combination is a little tight (one person at a time or one person showers while the other person uses the sink) .  The room itself though is quite comfortable, which is odd because normally my wife (who I LOVE more than life itself) is a snorer of a magnitude that would scare bears, but our cabin with the lights off was very dark, very quiet and very peaceful.  I think the ship motion knocked me cold, because on vacations where my wife and I share a room I generally either vacate at about 3 am to find a lobby or a nook to nap/read in or I listen to her snooze, but either way I don't get much sleep, but on this vacation I slept more than the last ten combined.You'll note I scored this ship as a five (excellent).  That doesn't mean things went perfect.  The difference was HOW things were handled.  For example, my television went out on the first day.  Normally not a big deal, especially since there's plenty to do on a ship this size. I called, they sent two techs who puzzled with it for about twenty minutes, before getting it fixed.  The kicker was the fifty dollar credit Princess gave us for a minor issue, without us even kicking a fuss.  Another minor problem, my medallion stopped working in the casino (you set up an account using it).  It worked everywhere else but the casino.  One of the guest services personnel actually accompanied me from their desk to the casino when the casino had difficulty resolving the technical issue to expedite the issue.  A phone call probably would have done it, but the personal touch was nice.  The people serving you on this ship are fantastic.  While your mileage may vary, my wife and I didn't meet a single person with an attitude, a bad mood or even a bit of irritation who took care of us during the entire trip.Our first trip was their Caribbean run with stops at Princess Cay (the lines private resort which they share with Carnival Cruises), St. Maarten and St. Thomas for a seven day trip.  Princess Cay was our favorite (we had booked a private cabin on the beach with a meal brought to us).  Having just left Iowa at a temperature just a little above 5 degrees and hitting the beach at a beautiful 72 degrees, it was paradise. Palm trees, attentive staff, the cabin itself had air conditioning and a private shower, our own loungers and umbrella with the beach bar just down about 100 feet from where we lay in the sun.  Total on this ran us about $300, but was well worth the price not to be crowded from every direction (my wife originally wanted a couple of loungers and a cloth clam shell for some shade, but I figured you get to do a first cruise once).  A word to the wise.  This type of excursion is listed as 0900-1500 (6 hours) but actually time works out to be really around four.  You get priority boarding on your own water shuttle for the money, but if the ship is late or there are delays, there isn't say a partial refund (or there might be, I didn't ask, and quite frankly I was happy not to be freezing).  The water shuttle is about fifteen to twenty minutes, and it will take you maybe another fifteen or so minutes to get situated at your private cabin.  Also, the priority shuttle is just to Princess Cay, you get to hop in line with everybody else on the way back to the ship, and you don't want to cut it to the last shuttle for the day.  Even still, the food, the sun and the privacy were well worth it for me.Next stop was St. Maarten after a sea day (which my wife spent in the spa getting a massage, a facial and a mani/pedi), and my wife I took a bus tour of the French and Dutch sides of the Island.  This is where the trip got a little weird, but I still stand by my excellent rating. The Regal Princess had an engine issue which forced it to reduce speed.  We ended up arriving several hours late, which caused the canceling of several tours and excursions (though luckily not ours).  From what I understand from my shipmates though, those who had canceled tours got refunds and Princess bent over backwards to provide plenty of alternative excursions to keep everybody happy, so if anyone was truly bent out of shape they kept it to themselves.  In any event, St. Maarten was both the most interesting but least favorite of the stops for me.  Dennis, our tour guide (who went to great pains to indicate he was Dennis but not a menace) had a lot of info at his command plus a no nonsense style about him, dealing with a few folks on the tour who had been to the island before and were giving their own spin on what they thought was important to see.  Dennis pointed out that he had rehearsed this gig as a single, and if that wasn't acceptable he knew a place they could swim back to the ship so everyone else could enjoy the tour.  The sad part was just the sheer destruction this island has suffered from multiple hurricanes over the years.  Nothing was hidden, you saw really interesting architecture and really poor neighborhoods.  We stopped at an old school 1950's carousel and ice cream parlour, and a shopping bazaar that anyone that's been across the San Ysidro border to TJ would recognize.  Last stop, St. Thomas.  Lots of duty free shops, lots of restaurants, my wife and I actually ventured onto land for a a couple of hours for dinner and a little shopping, but mainly stayed on board for half price massages.Sea days were dance classes (we learned to Cha Cha and Salsa), listened to a bunch of really great music groups, drank a lot, ate a lot, got more exercise than I thought would be possible (actually lost about five pounds from the start).  We had more fun than I would've thought possible.If you've lasted this long, the last bit is a top ten list of things I wish I knew/thought of before I climbed on board. 1.  Fly first class/business if you can afford to do so.  You will bring at least a weeks worth of clothes and other various odds and ends with you and you're unlikely to get it all into a carry on.  If you have to fly, you might as well have the airline eat the baggage charges (plus if you're a guy my size, you probably hate playing fatman's lottery, where you get there and you hope they don't decide to charge you for an extra seat anyway).  if they're going to do that, you might as well pay a little more, get a comfortable seat, not worry about baggage, get free drinks, board first, get off first and relax for a chage.2.  Try to get there a day before you leave.  Yeah, I know, you're already shelling out a big chunk of change for this cruise to begin with, but if you're going in off season like I did, you're taking a chance that you'll get delayed or have a flight canceled.  Even with trip coverage, you could still be on the hook for excursions and a non refundable deposit anyway.  Go a day early, see Ft. Lauderdale (or wherever)and build a little cushion into the process.3.  If you do fly into Ft. Lauderdale, and you have not arranged for friend or family/or your own rental, call a cab (I recommend yellow cab, 954-777-7777).  They will give you an estimate over the phone about how much it will cost you exactly to get from point A to B.  Why call a cab.  Because if you get their late, you'll likely bump into a bunch of guys roaming around, wearing lanyards, asking ""need a taxi""? Unless you called for one (or summoned an uber/lyft) do NOT accept.  My wife and I fell for this dodge.  These guys may look official, have nice vehicles, but once you're inside you'll notice no meter and they're probably doing everything off their cell phone.  A trip that should cost you ten bucks will cost you fifty.4. Put together your own sundries kit (tylenol, immodium, sea sickness meds, etc). A four pill pack onboard ship will cost you about four bucks, and its not like you can run to Walgreens.  There are a lot of great videos on you tube about doing just that, and I still forgot a couple of things.  Make a check list before you go.  If your wife has to have a particular brand of cold medicine, chances are they won't have it on board when you need it.5.  There is a Doctor on board the Regal Princess. That Doctor does not take Blue Cross/Blue Shield, United Health Care or any other insurance you care to name.  An examination will cost you $99.00.  For a nominal fee they will make a copy of their records so you can submit your own claim to your travel insurance or your own health care, but you get to pay up front. My wife hurt her foot while she and I raced through Charlotte, North Carolina's airport trying to make our connecting flight (see hint number 2).  Nothing broken, but to get peace of mind cost a little under a c note.6.  Princess Cruises still does a formal night.  This is going to the wayside on other cruises, but I happen to like it.  Depending on the number of nights at sea, you can have a certain number of formals (in our case it was two).  Guys need a dark suit or a tux, ladies an evening gown or fancy dress.  You can of course opt out of this, head to the pool on formal night or the buffet, but there's something to be said about dressing for dinner.7.  Drink packages.  They have drink packages for soda drinkers, coffee drinkers, and alcohol drinkers.  I purchased a soda package for myself and my wife had to have the specialty coffee package.  Doing the math you have to drink about five sodas a day minimum to make the soda package cost effective for you.  If you go over that amount you're saving money.  If you're a two to three pop a day person, save your money, because if you figure a cruise like mine, there are at least three days where you will be off ship anyway, not drinking the ships beverages.  Same deal on the alcohol.  The alcohol package covers drinks up to about $12.50 a pop (not the high end etoh), so if you drink more than say seven of those type of cocktails a day, you'll save money on the package.  A Corona will run you about $6.00.8. Excursions that indicate an activity level.  If they say strenouous, they mean you get to fill out a health liability form with questions like ""do you have a history of hypertension"" or ""do you have a history of diabetes"", etc.  If you answer any of those as yes, you need a Doctor's Waiver to participate.  Problem is, you don't generally find out about that until you're actually on board.  I had booked a scuba excursion with my wife, and we were both out based on a couple of different issues.  Luckily we could cancel and get our money back, but something to consider.  Even the one's that say ""light"" or ""easy"" may include some walking.  Our bus tour had us walk a good half mile to our buses, and there were a lot of people with canes and walkers that were not happy campers with the hike.9. If you have a flight out on the last day of the cruise out of Miami or Fort Lauderdale, book an excursion on that day.  That usually includes a tour that will deliver you right to the airport, especially good if you don't have a flight until that afternoon and don't feel like hauling around a weeks worth of luggage.  We took a paddle boat tour, saw a lot of really expensive real estate and yachts, and ate at a wonderful restaurant called Rocco's Tacos on Los Olas near the Riverside Hotel.10.  Most important.  Have fun.  Do not let the mickey mouse stuff make you lose your cool.  Getting ripped off by a fake cab driver my first night in Fort Lauderdale could have colored the entire trip.  Instead, a learning experience for a review. I had a blast, met a lot of wonderful people, and am going back as soon as I get the cash together.

This was a wonderful package and could not have been executed more skillfully by the Captain and crew.The package included the ceremony, flowers, framed photo, spa package, bridge visit, champagne breakfast, canapes, champagne & commemorative flutes, a box of chocolates, a Certificate, and two Princess Cruise robes.  Because there was a slight glitch on the champagne breakfast, we were treated to an all-expense dinner with our friends in Sabotini's restaurant (best on the ship).

We were already booked on the Regal Princess for the British Isles in May 2020 and we wanted to learn the  ship and evaluate the service. We were pleased and frankly impressed with several areas. First the embarkation and debarkation were the easiest we have experienced on any cruise line. The key to this is to complete all the necessary items to gain your ""medallion"" before departing home for the cruise. Secondly the ship was impeccably maintained and clean. Stateroom service was outstanding. Communications from the staff and crew was excellent, keeping us informed at all times.The food in the Horizon Court/Bistro was plentiful and good. Great selection for all nationalities. Dinner in the Symphony dining room was good. The selections could have been better but not a deal breaker. One of the highlight of the cruise was the nightly entertainment. The Princess dancers were excellent. The guest entertainers were as well as evidenced by the full auditorium each evening.

We had nine family members total on this cruise, which was nuts.  One 80-something, two 50s, and six 20s.  No dishes... awesome.  HINTS:  If you have family, buy the unlimited WiFi package.  We have two platinums and an elite in the group, which got us three reduced fee packages.  We bought two unlimited for $105 each for the week (each gets you four licenses, so we assigned one to each person, the 80-something used the 150 minutes free package. The morning you disembark, eat breakfast in the Allegro dining room.  It’s on 6 AFT, accessible only through the back elevators.  Uncrowded & peaceful, you are served and you don’t fight for seats. TOTALLY worth it.DO NOT take Princess’ transfer back to Miami airport if you’re more than two people.  A min-van cab will run you $80-85 with tip.  Uber = surge pricing. For five, Princess = $140 + tip. Cabs are waiting at the dock.  Similar idea if going to Ft. Lauderdale.  Take a cab if more than two people.Bonus:  for MIA, you can get off the ship LATER.  Our flights were at 2pm.  For the bus, we had to leave at 6:55.  With the cab, we went to the dining room at 7:30, left the ship at 9:15 and were at MIA at 10:45. Bring a small power strip, there’s only two plugs, and NONE by the bed, they’re by the desk.The medallions require a LOT of patience, especially if you need to swap rooms around as we did.

Notes about our cruise/cabin~*Easy transfer through Princess from the air port to the ship and getting settled on the ship.  We booked it all when we booked the cruise.*Regal uses the medallion, have it ready at all times.  You will use it every time you get on or off the ship, the casino, shops, for drinks, etc. We didn't purchase anything special to hold it, we just kept it in our pockets.*We did the anytime dining so we had the flexibility to do what we wanted when we wanted.  I prefer this method unless I'm traveling with a group.*The ship is very well cared for and the staff are always on.  From room cleaning, handrail cleaning, ship painting touch ups or anything you could imagine, the crew is always on top of it.*Very organized and information is available pretty much everywhere as far as shipboard activities to port tours. Your medallion will come in handy for this.*Lots of things to do indoor or out.  Tournaments, dancing, games, movies, singing, art, demonstrations, ship tours, tons of music, spa, work outs and so much more.  BUT, I would rate this ship and type of cruise for young adult on up.  It just wasn't little kid oriented other than the pool type activities.*Main/center of ship elevators are crazy busy and I highly recommend using the end elevators or stairs during a 'rush hour'.   I'm sure this is common on most ships as it has been on most of our cruises. *If booking a tour on this color tour cruise, it is important that you factor in the time it takes to tender to your port when deciding on and booking a tour time.  The Regal does not dock at each port.  For instance, you will take a tender from the Regal to the New Port dock and the same in Bar Harbor.*The night movies on deck are fun.  Dress warm and enjoy with a cozy blanket!*We received a free drink package for two.  Drink packages are quite expensive and unless you have to walk around with a drink in your hand every minute, you might want to weigh the pros and cons of price.  We never would of used it enough to pay for it out right.*We did purchase and use the wifi package.  Service was spotty, nothing you can really do about that on a ship out in the water.*If you plan to see an evening show, you need to get there early.  Seats fill up quickly and you'll see people getting there an hour ahead.  The late show is usually less busy.*If you go hungry, it's your own fault ;)",Sail Date: October 2019|Cabin Type: Suite|Type of Trip: |Destination: Canada|,

Weather can be iffy, which is true of the countries we visited. Weather changes hourly. We did not take this cruise to get a tan. Princess is a five-year old, large, beautiful ship with an excellent captain and friendly, professional crew. We saw a high degree of cleanliness everywhere on the ship, something that can fall short during two weeks nearly 5,000 on board. Our stateroom was spacious and comfortable. Breakfast and lunch buffets were extraordinary in variety. Evening dinner at a table for two was a joy. There were enough big stage shows, comedies and classical trio performances to suit us. Good rock and jazz bands in clubs. Great spa. Big gym. It was easy to get used to the ship’s new medallion technology featuring a chip with guest identification for all sorts of activities. The captain set a course between two hurricanes, and, during one phase of the crossing, he ordered the ship's foghorn to blow every few minutes, a reminder of the perils of the sea. The weather from Nova Scotia to NYC was sunny and beautiful, as it was in Copenhagen, Ireland, Scotland and New York.Swells rising around the ship proved to be a startling sight. We felt a sway as we stood afternoons rehearsing with 70 fellow passengers and the very engaging ship’s assistant cruise director Ana for a pop choir show in the Piazza atrium; but, with the 27-foot stabilizers steadying the way, we never missed a meal and slept like babies in a cradle.",Sail Date: September 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: United States|,"St. Petersburg, Florida"

There are 3 dinning rooms, any amount of bars and lounges where you can read or play cards or any other games you enjoy. The maitre d'h., was very nice and always kept the same table for us 4. I recommend not to pay in advance for your drinks, including beer and wine because it is very expensive ( $US 700 per person for the whole trip, unless you think you will be able to go through it. There are different shows in the evening. Quite good. Musicals, ballet etc., cinemas, bingo, roulet, black jack disco etc. The athmosphere is very jolly and everybody very happy. As there is more than one dinning room one practically does not bump into others or has to wait for a table. The food is super. Every day a different delicious dish, and breakfast is also very good. You can have anything you think of. All the crew is very amiable and very helpful. There are various bars where you can have any delicious cocktail going. I think in all it was 11 days of cruising reaching Stokholm, Helsinsky,St, Petersburg (1 night) Tallin, Warnemunde (there is a tour you get on board to Berlin. I I do not recommend it. You have to board a train for 3 hours, then a bus tour in Berlin, lunch and 3 hours back to Warnemunde.) and finally Oslo to reach Copenhagen. In between there are 3 days of cruising where one can make the most of the pool with drinks from the bar.",Sail Date: June 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Europe|,"Buenos Aires, Argentina"

Sailing the Baltic aboard the Regal proved to be the smoothest sail we have ever experienced and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to cruise but is concerned about seasickness.  Six port cities with many excursions to pick from kept us busy.  Onboard activities were plentiful to choose from and left us tired at days end.  We loved the game shows, trivia, and Princess Theatre shows.  The beds were sooooo comfortable and with a controllable room thermostat and room-darkening drapes, we slept very well every single night.  Anytime Dining worked well for our group of four and the wait staff was both friendly and professional.  We ate primarily in the Symphony Dining Room and at the buffet (plentiful options) with visits to International Cafe and Alfredo’s Pizza.  The special British Pub Lunch was a welcome treat.  Customer Service did an outstanding job in assisting us in getting our missing piece of luggage to the ship (3 days after sailing) and supplying us with a shaving kit and free tuxedo for formal night usage to help get us through.  On those hot days coming back from excursions, the Regal staff was there to greet you with ice cold towels and cool cucumber or orange infused water - a very welcome treat.The Medallion Class worked out very well.

Our first on the ship was in the year it was launched (2014) and it's obvious that some of the rooms are a little run-down 5 years into its service.  I have some food allergies, which means I make the personal acquaintance of one of the head waiters, and he took great care of me the entire trip. We seldom used the buffet, and for that I am thankful, because every time we were there it was packed and there were few places to sit. The itinerary on this cruise was pretty good but not great. My biggest objection is the stop at Warnemunde which is billed as Berlin. A quick look at a map shows that Berlin is far inland and nowhere near any ocean. We had a 15-hour stop and about half of the people on the ship took excursions to Berlin, which involved about 7 hours on a train and just a few hours in the city itself.  My husband and I stayed in Warnemunde and went on a long bike ride, which was a nice outing and very relaxed.  The long stay in Warnemunde gave us just 6 hours in Oslo, which really is not enough.  Of all the stops, the biggest and most pleasant surprise was Tallin. We were not expecting much, I must admit, but were delighted by what we saw. We took a bike tour out to an outdoor museum that has dozens of antique farmhouses collected on site, then went into the old town itself for a short visit.  Perfect day (albeit cold).  My advice to potential cruisers is:   -- Look for specials. We managed to snag two upgrades that were available in the year before we took the cruise, getting a mini-suite for the price of a balcony room, plus the unlimited beverage option for free.    -- Consider going later in the year so you don't freeze your booty off at every stop.

We chose this early date so I could see the Keukenhof in Amsterdam while the tulips were in bloom. I certainly do not recommend this ship or sail date, however.   It has been extremely cold in the Baltic, and the hallways and dining rooms on the ship are freezing. The ship also has a new technology system, which we found does not work at all. My husband tried to download three different apps to find friends, order a drink, and get around the ship, but after wasting time on three separate occasions trying to get help, none of these ever downloaded for him. The entertainment on the ship  is good in the theater, but if you would like a bar or lounge with good music and intimate dancing, there is very little of that. Most of the entertainment takes place in the central piazza, where there are not nearly enough seats for the 3000+ passengers, and one has to dance under bright lights with people on three different levels are staring down at you. If you like to play ping-pong, forget it—the  table has been moved into the teen area and adults are  relegated to a very short time every day during which they canplay.  If you choose to do shore excursions, I recommend you not do them with princess but with another company, because those vendors limit the number of people on the tours, are far better organized, and are less expensive. The food in the dining room is good, but it is not always hot, and the same is true with the bistro on the top deck.  In our case, we had to cancel an expensive excursion because I was having stomach cramps very early in the morning and felt I could not go, and when we told the ship about this in order to get our refund, they insisted that I had some sort of gastrointestinal ailment and made me stay in my room all day. I never got sick another time the entire day, and despite the fact that I told them this repeatedly, they kept me a prisoner, threatening to force us to disembark at the next stop if I came out of my room!

As this was a one week cruise from New York to New England and Canada and back, the itinerary was originally very port intensive with only one scheduled sea day.  The itinerary included port calls in: Newport, RI; Boston, MA; Bar Harbor, ME, St. John, NB; and Halifax, NS.  The Regal Princess is a large ship and is similar to the other ships in the Princess fleet, but is more elegant and more classic.  The ship's crew is very professional and courteous; it was a joy to be on this cruise.  The food is excellent in the Main Dining Rooms and the choices in the Horizon Court buffets were also excellent.  The balcony room was very comfortable and the Princess beds were so comfortable.  The balcony was a bit small, but because of the generally cold and not so great weather at sea, we did not spend much time outdoors.  Unfortunately because of rough seas and high winds, the port call to Bar Harbor was called off and we had a sea day.  The crew adapted quite well and new activities on board were quickly organized.  The Ultimate Ship Tour is a must.  It was great to tour the insider's view of the ship and we spent a nice time with Captain Tim Stringer who was delightful and full of information and wit.  One thing that we really enjoyed on this sail was there was not the usual pressure to shop at stores in the ports and on the ship.  It was low key and very refreshingly pleasant. Also, the sailaway from the Brooklyn Terminal is just magnificent as we passed by Lower Manhattan, the Statue of Liberty and then under the Verrazano Narrows Bridge.

It was returned 3 times - could not eat it - felt ill - the head waiter aware of the situation.Formal night? We dressed up for dinner - others in shorts, t-shirts and flip flops. 11pm to put cases out on last night  -  last minute changed to 10pm - just before dinner.  Not possible, not back from dinner which took so long.Booked trips in uk but on ship they had been changed - money added onto bill.  Trip on home flight day cancelled for some reason.

As first time cruisers, we were really apprehensive and unsure what to expect but there was no need to have worried as we had the most fantastic time and our 5 star expectations were met and exceeded. From check in at the Dubai terminal, everything was so well organised and streamlined and we were able to get checked in and on the ship within 10 minutes. Despite route changes and missed ports, nothing dampened this holiday experience at all for us.A beautiful ship with the most stunning dome ceiling and parties every night on the promenade. The crew and staff were all great, polite, friendly and helpful. Our waiter Agnung (apologies if spilled incorrectly) was fantastic as were all his helpers. They always had time to talk and offer advice despite how busy they were.  He made suggestions for wine choices, was attentive and loved to have a chat every evening.Our balcony cabin and the rest of the ship was kept spotlessly clean and there was hand gel everywhere to keep sanitising. The room was well designed, modern and spacious and we had plenty of room. We were able to store our suitcases under the bed which was nice. The cabin was cleaned twice a day which was just perfect.The food was excellent, we ate in the marketplace buffet restaurant for breakfast and lunch most days and everything was always hot and fresh.  We could always find space and never had to queue and as soon as we were seated, the waiter was there offering drinks. The main allocated restaurant we were assigned was perfect and the menu was varied and changed nightly. We chose the late dining option at 9.15 pm which allowed us time to watch the 7.30 pm show, have a drink before dinner and then after the show enjoy the promenade party. The London theatre was state of the art with amazing screens and amazing and talented performers every night including, singing, dancing, magic and acrobatics. Really there was something for everyone. We did also try the included a la carte lunch on one day and also the a la carte breakfast on the last day, both were superb. We didn't try the speciality restaurants but will next time.Service at the bars and waiter service were both excellent and the choice of drinks on our premium drinks package was just perfect as it included lovely cocktails,  Prosecco and branded spirits. We spent a full day off the ship in Abu Dhabi and had an amazing time there. We hired a private driver and planned our own day. We left the ship for the Sir Bani Yas island day and spent a few hours lazing around on the beach. The food there was also included and also our drinks package was in use there too. Again organisation for getting to and from the island via tenders was perfect.We watched both Cirque du Soleil shows, one dinner package and one cocktail and loved both of them. We are big Cirque fans so was great to be up so close and personal at the shows and the dinner was incredible. Please note that drinks package is not included at the Cirque shows so we did treat ourselves to some champagne that evening.The shops on board were not bad either and we bought some nice souvenirs to take away.Overall we had a fantastic week, relaxing and enjoying the ship's facilities, it was our first MSC cruise and I would definitely go with them again. Actually 3 days after we got back we already have booked a 14 day cruise with them around the caribbean for 2021.

This is truly a beautiful ship but staffed with some of the most unenthusiastic, sour crew I have ever encountered. I have sailed with RCI, Norweigan and Celebrity and the MSC experience left me cold. Guest Services have a very long queue leading to nothing,  I had an query on my account,  they could not sort it out. It transpired that the credit card that had paid the cruise deposit had expired, even though current card was registered on the first day there was a problem. I also felt I was being accused of some dishonesty as another reviewer said. Food in the Marketplace was cold and boring. We paid for a meal in the Tapas Bar to be given a raw burger. Butchers Cut was very expensive and two of my sons were ill later. The food in the Les Cerises was obviously from the Marketplace Buffet.  Cirque Do Soleil was very good but  extra, the Formula 1 simulator was extra most of the entertainment was extra.

We had a fantastic time, despite route changes and missed ports. It was unfortunate, but cannot be helped with the situation with Corona virus.  A beautiful ship with the amazing ceiling shows in the promenade each evening!The crew and staff were all great, polite, friendly and helpful. Our waiter Saurabh was lovely. He made suggestions for wine choices, was attentive and loved to have a chat every evening.The ship was kept spotlessly clean and there was hand gel everywhere if people have concernsThe food was excellent, we ate in the buffet restaurant for breakfast and lunch, although we found out later in the week that we could have dined in the restaurant for breakfast had we wanted to. To be honest there was no need, there is a huge choice of food, it could look a bit daunting sometimes, trying to find your way all around the food stations! I didn't find a problem with it being busy as some have mentioned. We didn't sit at the front of the restaurant, always went straight to the back where there were plenty of tables and fewer crowds, much quieter. We sat outside at the back most of the time so it was really pleasant.Service at the bars could be quite slow, we often found it quicker to find a table and order from a waiter than to queue at the bar, the drinks occasionally did take quite some time to arrive however, I think maybe one or two more people behind the bar making the cocktails would have made a difference her. To be honest though, we spent the time chilling and chatting so weren't too concerned about this. We had the premium drinks package so made the most of the lovely cocktails, Prosecco and branded spirits. It was well worth it for us as we like to try different things and knew we would be wanting cocktails.We found out that it is important, if you register your debit card for spending on board, that you return to the cruise card machine before departure to close your account. We didn't realise we had to do this so were sent back to reception when trying to disembark. We were owed money left on the authorisation and were returned it in Euros cash. Not ideal, I would register a credit card next time I think, although someone has also mentioned they didn't register any card and just charged to their cabin and payed on departure. Might be the easier option I think!We left the ship for the Sir Bani Yas island day and spent a few hours lazing around on the beach. The food there was also good although, obviously not so much choice it was mostly barbecue foods but delicious all the same.We also left the ship for a few hours in Dubai on our last day. We booked a large taxi with a company based in the terminal building and chose our route. We only wanted to go to the Souks, across the river then to the Miracle Gardens. There were 4 of us and it cost us 120 Euros for around 3 hours. Not sure if this is expensive or not but the other option to catch taxis to and from the venues seemed a bit daunting as we hadn't done it before. We only went to one show, the Rock evening which was great, good music and only a short 35 minute show which suited us wellThe bars were all lovely, The Masters of the sea was a great 'pub' and we spent our evenings either there, in the Bellissima Lounge or out one the aft deck during the day, sitting in the sunshine for a refreshing beer! Overall we had a fantastic week, relaxing and making the most of the ship's facilities, it was our second MSC cruise and I would definitely return.",Sail Date: February 2020|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Middle East|,"Caerphilly, United Kingdom"

My wife and I have never sailed with MSC before, and since it's a year old ship we thought we had give it a try.  The Good: For it's size, the embarkation was relatively smooth and orderly. The theater show and the two Circus Soleil show were exceptional. The sofa in our balcony cabin could fit three person comfortably which we did not expect. Children area on the ship were large and activities were aplenty. The dome in the promenade with different display every day was impressive.The Bad: Food from the buffet and sit down dinning were salty and lack of variety. Steak lover will be disappointed on this cruise. Wine & Dine packages were ask four to five times at your sit down table per seating by different staff. It kills the atmosphere and defeat the sole reason of a sit down dinning. Very annoying. There weren't any placement for the Daily Program outside the cabin door and it only get delivered inside your cabin every night after 9PM making next day activity planning difficult. Aside from the dinning room, services were lack luster elsewhere.

I loved the service at the pool bar and especially Mr. Sayed amongst others whose names I forgot. Next month will be MSC DIVINA in a Yacht Club cabin.

I purchased a drinks package and excursions pre boarding so that I knew my costs upfront.  It is not until you book this ship and you go to my booking you then learn that many of the activities i.e. bowling is not free.  If you want to play you need to buy the play package!  These are sold i.e 3 tiers top price, middle and bottom - not cheap.    The point is  you cant just play one or two games.  So you either get hooked in and need to use up all the credit you have purchased on this package or just do not bother.   Pre cruise we also booked the show Cirqu du Soleil apparently this Theatre  is a separate company from MSC and only when you are told to select your food choices you learn that your drinks package card cannot be used at this event. I felt this should have been pointed out when booking this show (another extra cost if you want to buy wine or water etc).I want to thank Amawantara Igusti (Indonesia) & Vie Ruel Cruz (Phillipin) for outstanding care and service on board. Best restaurant Butchers Cut, superb food and these two guys were exceptional and went the extra mile.  Also Alona Guest Services after lots of queuing re issues and complaining, she sorted everything out again a very helpful lady.  Toilets were kept spotless and their sinks dispensed soap (when it had some it and often many were empty) and water without touching.  Pool decks crowded sunbathers just like sardines in the tin, do you really want to lay that close to a stranger!Edge Bar lovely if you can get a table, given this ship holds around 5,500 people they need to provide more table and chairs and yes there is space to do so.  This is a major problem when its a day at sea.Was served cold poached eggs in the restaurant twice so gave up with them.  The buffet was horrific too many people barging you and leaning over you. So stressful. The noise levels are an assault on your ears, Hated the smell of  cigarettes as this ship has smoking areas (Casino) that you often have to walk through to get to where you are going i.e Cirqu du Soleil Theatre as well as outdoor where two of the pools are. Given this is a new ship the design in the cabin is lacking it feels smaller than a balcony cabin I have had on a P&O ship, who also have larger wardrobe space,  Bellissima cabin has a Huge sofa (obviously a sofa bed) leaving little space to separate the double bed into two singles, not nearly enough space apart!  The ship is really too big and with so many people to distribute.  I also believe this ship is marketed to full capacity especially when at sea.  Staff are constantly trying to sell you a new food option that is not included in your package. Its all about the money they can make from you and not the experience.",Sail Date: February 2020|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Middle East|,"Royal Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom"

Look no further, it’s the MSC Bellissima. While a beautiful new ship, it’s overcrowded without the staff to support the 4,500 passenger load. Antiquated card based POS systems only make things worse, especially when trying to incorporate the medallion RFID system.Unsure if it’s the Italian way of doing business, or the staff is overwhelmed, but the organization is fraught with problems, inefficiencies, and has the potential for very unsanitary operating conditions, especially in the buffet area (no soap or sanitary lotion many times).Management, staff, and ship designers need to get together and learn from the mistakes made on this ship. An easy fix is to them go on a Sky Princess Cruise, and see how it’s done right. If you want long lines, poor service, nonfunctioning medallion systems, lots of waiting, crowded conditions, then go on this ship. This is a poor value for the money, and may lead to an awful experience. Choose another ship, and another cruiseship line.Poor OrganizationThe hallmark of poor management and staff is if you have to spend time dealing with issues. On this ship, all the staff can do is listen. For some reason, they can’t do much to resolve issues.Take Action: Always keep track of your bill. Make notes, take photos, and document any idiosyncracies. It’s more profound when you are paying more than normal cruises. Visit guest experience and let them know what is wrong. Unfortunately, on this ship your concerns fall on deaf ears.Not enjoying your cruise ? Provide factual reviews online. This helps keep cruise lines accountable for their actions. It may not help you, but will help the next potential guest.Ship FlowDivide and Conquer: The ship is divided into the fancy Yacht Club (forward and upper decks). And the economy class back and lower. Expect a poor experience unless you are in the Yacht Club level.The ship is beautiful. Clearly some thought went into her design, but fails in the upper decks where most people congregate. Specifically the sun deck areas, and the buffet. Clearly, nobody ran computer flows to see where passengers would be the bottleneck. Problems compound, which makes life difficult for the staff.Unless you’re on the main promenade, it’s hard to navigate from forward to stern on the ship. Luckly, the elevators are plentiful.Awful POS SystemThe worst point of sales system I’ve seen in the past 10 years. Not sure if it’s the Italian way, or just merging technologies that won’t blend.The medallion system works intermittently, but rarely when you need it (when purchasing anything). Expect to see a written receipt in triplicate every now and then. The Italians seem to like the antiquated, least efficient method, of delivering an experience.The bottom line is that you’ll spend more time trying to resolve simple issues, than the cruise itself. Avoid this ship.Top 10 Reasons To Avoid MSC Bellissima:1. Overcrowded ship capacity leads to cut corners. It’s a management problem . Cut corners leads to unclean conditions and poor service.2. Food Quality: Buffet good (super crowded). Free restaurants average to poor food quality. The paid upsell lobster dinner, was awful. Specialty restaurants were good to fantastic (Tepanyaki experience amazing). Your paid drink package doesn’t work in the specialty upsell restaurants. If you’re a couple, buy the specialty restaurant package to save money. If you’re trying to buy packages for more than two people, or pay for other people, good luck working with the system that has lots of problems when you want to buy something.3. Yacht Club: while you may get exceptional experience in this separate class, you are on the same crowded ship. I was in standard passenger class. If you go on this ship, only book Yacht Club level. At least you have a comfortable space to relax in.4. Long Wait: expect long lines. Made worse when ship is fully booked, since they don’t have the staff to keep up with the crowds. Expect nowhere to sit or layout on a sunny day on the upper decks. Poor food quality in the lower deck free restaurants, results in lots of people at the lunch and evening buffet, which results in the buffet running out of plates, dinnerware, or poor cleaning. The dinnerware was of so questionable cleanliness, that we typically would grap up to 5 sets each, because most were still dirty.5. Questionable Cleanliness: Overcrowded means limited (or no) soap or hand sanitizer in food areas.6. Unhappy Crew: Overcrowding and limited staff means existing crew was overworked. Lack of sleep and lack of rest, combined with poor management, results in a less than energetic crew. This results in product (or service) shorting. 7. A La Carte Pricing: drink pre-paid packages don’t work at specialty restaurants. Skip the drink packages.8. Internet Access: Service is inconsistent, and sometimes very slow. Service only works with one device at a time (can’t tether or share). Expensive (I paid around 148 Euro - but then had to buy for our group since bracelets didn’t work for location services).9. Bracelets: prepare to spend hours with guest services to make them work. The don’t work with POS (point of sales) charge devices. POS still used paper receipt system. Antiquated system means more wait time, and less time enjoying your cruise.10. Passenger and Crowd Flow: There were a number of bottlenecks, which result in frustration and poor passenger experience. This is a super beautiful ship (probably the nicest big ship I’ve seen) but someone didn’t put the time into running the analytics for computational flow design in the original design stage (orr was not properly executed in the build stage). In either case, more wait time, less experience.Fixes: Lots of easy fixes, but in some cases, would reduce MSC profit. Easiest fix is more crew, to service increased capacity. The biggest fix is eliminating the legacy card system, and go straight to the medallion system which is used successfully on Princess Cruises. Eliminate the paper receipts altogether. Just a big waste of time and paperwork. These are real basic strategies that should have been employed along time ago by MSC management. Somebody isn’t doing their job in the top ranks.

It helps derive purpose, and gives meaning to your day.My Best Pro-Tips of All Time:1. The most productive hours of the day, are your first 6 hours, use them wisely. Make any important decisions during the morning. 2. The best calorie burn, and least insulin resistance, is eating the biggest meal prior noon, then light dinner.3. The best way to reduce age is to have calorie restriction, less protein, intermittent fasting, good sleep, and cold or hot temps (slightly uncomfortable), with short intensive workouts.4. If you’re a late night person, drop the vampire schedule for a morning early bird schedule. You will be more productive, alert, and come up with better ideas.5. Follow the Sun. Humans crave daylight. The same applies for your cell dynamics. Circadian rhythm is a valuable asset. Learn how to use it to your advantage.6. Have a plan and stick to it. You can always adjust as needed, but a ship needs to have a course.7. Develop a niche.

Bathroom was a good sizeOur cabin steward Kodak was great really looked after us However our room was below sun deck and if you were in your room it was very noisy with the scraping of chairs etc Restaurant Food was good always came hot, even though the portions of vegetables was very small and limited Waiting staff were excellent very friendly hard working no problems with them speaking English or understanding you Buffet was a bit of a free for all I couldn't believe they only had 2 toasters one you had to put bread through about 4 times before it browned then it was too hard to eat  never once had a hot breakfast everything spread out too far not well organised Entertainment was good we only went to 2 shows and the 2 circus de Soleil we really enjoyed those, but the white party and 70s 80s party were on at 11:30pm ok if you have lots of sea days but apart from 1 day we were in ports so never went to these party s as we would never have got up for the ports but did enjoy the music in the lounge Tours were expensive if you booked through ship but when you got off you could hire a taxi for as long as you wanted or pay for the local hop on hop off etc much cheaper than the ships prices I did feel for the staff they work very long hours and work very hard, they spend a long time away from their families tending to the passengers needs I did on many many occasions witness particularly the Italian passengers treat the staff with utter contempt treating them as their personal butlers never saying a please or a thank you, this did really upset me . I witnessed them demanding cutlery, drinks, 'go get' Having spoken to some of the waiting staff the general response was the Italians in particular do not like to wait the want it NOWI experienced this first hand when waiting for the lift if you weren't quick enough they would close the lift doors before you got there, or when queuing for bar service they would walk in front of you and shout at bar staff. On the last night when having queued for quite some time at quest services several Italians came from nowhere and walked in front went straight to the person on counter and demand the be seen to immediately when I complained they just shouted at me in Italian.  They never held a door if you were going through it or me er even acknowledged that you held a door for them I dont think please or thank you is in their vocabulary Nothing to do with speaking English we can all make ourselves understood for with gratitude or politeness This attitude was present throughout my cruise which did spoil it. Even though everything else was good I probably would not go with MSC again due to the rudeness , demanding impatient attitude of a predominantly Italian clientele I have cruised for many years and have never experienced this type of rudeness ( and I have seen a lot) disregard, disrespect for other staff and other nationalities Which is a shame as the ship and staff are good",Sail Date: January 2020|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Middle East|,"Cardiff, United Kingdom"

An inaugural voyage will be something special, I thought.It started well as the check-in process in Southampton was far smoother than in Genoa 13 months ago but that’s probably down to the better organisation of the port than MSC’s doing.We boarded a brand spanking new ship, it smelt new and was clean and gleaming.Arguably too gleaming as the Swarovski encrusted staircases in the main atrium certainly glistened but were they too chavvy and tacky.Much fanfare has been made of the 260’ long LED Skydome and, yes, it looks impressive but 95% of the time it has a static display, changing occasionally it is visually impressive. However more use could be made of it – it only comes to life three times a day when a much vaunted video display is shown – don’t stop doing anything else to watch one as it is distinctively underwhelming.Rather than using the video ceiling to its full potential it looks as though the mini-shows, rarely lasting longer than three minutes, have been produced by A-level students as part of a media project.If you’ve ever seen the LED show in Freemont Street in Las Vegas you will be bitterly disappointed with this effort …… it may be an idea for MSC to send someone to Vegas to see how the screen can be used to its full potential.Anyway, I digress, we made our way to the cabin which was easy to find but challenging to get into. Controlled by an NFC card, which doubled as a cruise card, the door seemingly unlocked but resolutely would not open. We tried both our cards several times but were still stuck outside our cabin. Luckily a passing cabin steward appeared and we explained the predicament and he showed us how to open the door.You present the key, press the handle and basically shoulder charge the door to gain entry ….. yes the door was so tight it was the only way to open it, although it did ease after a few days.The opposite of this was you had to give the door a hard push or slam to ensure it closed properly.The cabin itself was very narrow, there was only just room between the foot of the bed and the opposite wall to pass by comfortably.The wardrobe was small.The redeeming feature of the cabin was the bathroom, which was clean and, for a cruise ship, relatively spacious.We had to share the cabin with Zoe, who advertised as being your intelligent assistant, I would describe her as Alexa’s dumb, inbred cousin, with learning difficulties. Unless you were enquiring about something that could be sold to you her stock answer was to speak to a member of the crew or the information desk.Intelligent she wasn’t, annoying she very much was. Interestingly she was screwed to the desk, presumably to stop passengers throwing her overboard.The cabin creaked terribly, so much so I woke up more than once thinking someone was walking across the cabin.I have never known a ship roll so much, I can only assume the vessel has not been fitted with stabilisers or if it has, they were not working. One night the roll was so bad our beds actually slid across the cabin and all the toiletries in the bathroom fell off the shelves.Yet despite the obvious bad rolling, despite the first stop in La Coruna being cancelled due to the bad weather we heard nothing at all from the Captain or the bridge, he may as well not been there.Indeed, the only time the Captain deigned to mix with the passengers was for the photo opportunity. I have to say this custom of being photographed with the Captain strikes me as being odd …… why do it.If I catch a train I don’t want a photo with the driver, if I catch a bus I don’t want a photo with the driver, so why would I want a photograph of me with the driver of a ship?Speaking of photography, MSC seem to have a breeding colony of photographers as you cannot walk more than a few yards without one of the official photographers trying to get you to pose for yet another photograph, which you can buy at an extortionate price. The only place you seemed to be free of the photographers was in the toilets, although they’ll probably set up there next.Now, a subject dear to my heart, food.Quality tended to be hit and miss with food ranging from sublime (interestingly in the speciality restaurants) to poor with average being the general standard.Portion sizes in the main restaurant can be best described as frugal and, even on special nights, the meals were only three courses ….. some nights we came away from the restaurant feeling hungry.The individual waiting staff could not be faulted and they worked hard.Dinner on the first night was absolutely chaotic with massive gaps between courses and wrong orders being delivered. However, it was the first night and such problems were to be expected. In fairness by the third night service was slick and the correct meals appeared.For me the biggest “rip off” are their speciality restaurants. Yes, all cruise lines have speciality restaurants, which carry a premium price tag. Having already paid for meals in the main restaurant proper cruise lines like P&O and Cunard will charge a nominal cover charge, usually in the £20 - £30 range to eat in a speciality restaurant, something most passengers wouldn’t quibble at.MSC, on the other hand, are crafty. They describe their main restaurant meals as “complementary” – that was a surprise when I saw it in blue and white on the TV screen in my cabin. That means if you eat in a speciality restaurant on am MSC ship you aren’t upgrading your dining experience and paying a supplement, you are being charged full price and more.We paid €125 for a three course meal in in their Butchers Cut steakhouse restaurant and that was basically going for the “cheapest” filet steak. Yes the quality was good and the service excellent but still a lot of money for basically a steak, especially when you have supposedly already paid for a main meal.Of course there is also the buffet, the ruck and maul of dining. MSC is an Italian based cruise line and a large number of passengers on board are, therefore, Italian. Whilst it is generally wrong to begin stereotyping ,this does have an adverse impact on the enjoyment of the cruise …… especially if eating in the buffet.Dress codes seem to be optional, at best. One aspect of cruising I like are the formal nights where you dress up for dinner. With, again what I call traditional cruise lines, the code is strictly enforced. With MSC there is no enforcement whatsoever.On this cruise there were three “formal” or as they call them “elegant” nights. On the first one I would say 70% made the effort, the second about 30% and by the third one only about 10% made the effort.On one of the nights I was wearing my dinner jacket and the chap sitting next to me was wearing jeans and an open neck shirt ……. It makes you wonder why bother?Turning to entertainment and I use the term loosely.The London Theatre is small for the number of passengers, so much so you have to book if you want to guarantee a place, otherwise take part in a scrum for any remaining seats five minutes before the show starts.The shows from the in house team were OK, they were reasonably good singers, although the choreography was limited. What did spoil some of the shows was appalling lighting. There were some horrendous strobe effects, without any prior warning and spotlights, more often than not missed the intended performer.The other shows were a very clever and funny mime artist and the worlds worse ventriloquist – I’m not sure if he was deliberately bad or was just untalented, suffice to say many walked out and he was almost booed off stage.WE didn’t waste any money on excursions and we didn’t fall for any of the usual MSC cons. For example in Lisbon they were selling open bus tour tickets for the special price of €27, whereas you could buy the very same ticket on the bus for €22.They also still operate their big con job in Marseille where they charge €15.99 for a shuttle bus to the city centre and back, whereas if you’re prepared to take a 10 minute walk to the edge of the security area, the city of Marseille provide a free shuttle bus ……. of course MSC forget to tell you this.So, in summary, a new glittering ship, although it has to be said even after only a week the carpets in the corridors were beginning to look tatty.It is, however grossly overhyped and is very chavvy in places.It is the typical MSC experience where they set out to screw you for as much money as possible and you come away with a feeling of being ripped off.",Sail Date: March 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Europe|,"Milton Keynes, United Kingdom"

The negative about this my partner requested a bottle of champagne for my birthday this never arrived but it was paid for on my account!! We noticed this on return.  We used the buffet for breakfast and snacks the food was always plentful with a good selection available at all times, the down side of this were the other passengers who pushed and took what they wanted without any regard for others. (This i know is not the cruise staff faults).  Horizon pool was ok bar service over there was non existant i sat at the bar for over 30 mins while one person serving.  The outdoor pool was nice but did not like the smoking around the pool area i know it is only in one area but there were a lot of children around.  The bar service was again non existant the pool buffet was ok not a lot of variety so if you wanted somthing different from hot dogs you had to dress and go into the buffet .  The juzzui area if you could get into one of them without the kids jumping in i did not like that much, would have been nice if there was an adult only area for swimming and relaxing in a juzzui.  The adult only bar you had to walk across the deck to get to to far away from anything but it did have a nice view overlooking the pool deck.  Entertainment or lack of it around the pool especially on sea days was not very good you dont want to hear loud banging music but some sort of music would have been nice.  The coffee bar and lounge area was lovely as was the staircase, the shopping mall was fab especially the changing ceiling. The Masters of the Sea pub was a great place to go for a drink.

Finally by our insistance, we gt the cabin 2 days later but nobody refunded those days wasted.When you buy a drinking package, they force you to buy the same for all the cabin, even though they don´t drink whatever you are planning to drink, so in my case with me, my wife and my 2 children i had to spend 500 euros only to drink sodas. Ridiculous. And even if you buy it if one of the children want ice cream you have to pay it... When in other cruise lines IT IS ALWAYS COMPLIMENTARY.Everything is a struggle and the place most visited is guest services, which is unpleasant and always treat you as a thief and always trying to take advantage of everything and never listening to the customer.Every service that the cruise offers, such as bowling, F1 simulator, VR, etc, THEY ARE ALL EXTRA, in other cruises almost all of them are complimentary and again with all this Italian pirate line, it´s a disasterAbout shore excursions is a mess, we had one handiccapped passenger in our group and they treated her like if she was cattle, never helping and without providing any service (By the way they got off the cruise 2 days early for this whole nightmare)The disco is next to the kids club, so by the adults only time, you can see a lot of teenagers under 18 that are also drinking alcohol without any control or security, congratulations again to the mastermind of the shipDuring the cruise they charge you a fee per person per week without notice and also when you complain, they don´t remove it unless you ask them to (70 euros per person per week) so is a bunch of money per cabin and also forcing you without asking. Even if you paid all the services and gratuitites in advance as we did.The payment is another issue, the currency exchange from euros to usd they just steal 5% in exchange difference, and also the payments go through a machine, which is a mess, and if there is a bill that the machine doen´t take it, nobiody in the ship helps you or exchanges you the bill.

Very new ship and concept too !!, this ship was definitely given the glimpse of the modern era of the cruise line, What I understood that this ship is built for the Chinese market and after completing the middle east segment by 21st march 2020.Check-in: If you are a resident of UAE you can park your car at the port free of cost (This information need to verify as Dubai parking rules change with the time), I park my car within the parking lot and very smooth check-in.Terminal: Terminal 3 is assigned to ""Bellissima"", must tell you it is a very beautiful building and offer free WiFi.Step1: Clear the immigration it is very quick.Step 2: Check-in with Ship staff and collect the cabin card, they retain the passport against valid receipt.Security check: As you must have dropped your big luggage at just before entering the terminal with the ship staff, just pass through security just like an airport.walk to the ship, enter the ship ensure you are not allowed to take a photo or shoot video at the entrance of ship as their staff who check your cabin ID they offended.Exterior: It is the giant ship, she looks elegant though.Interior: Dack 4 is the entry/exit deck dack 5,6 & 7 are the lounge, giving luxury feeling.Way to the cabin: Cabin layout is different than what generally we experienced in past, bit confusing and not in a straight line, but proper information all around will ease the task to locate the cabin.Cabin: We were on 9th dack with balcony cabin and was impressively clean and well-arranged, utilize the space brilliantly, ZOE is the new feature but not easy to operate and we have avoided.""We must thank the staff for housekeeping they really serve better with a smile""Food: We were allocated LightHouse for our dinner, the first evening since we have not communicated about our choice of food (Indian - Veg) even they managed for us and ""Ms. Marliene"" and ""Mr. Suastika Ketut"" they have taken care for us for all 7 nights.""Masala Tea: Mr. Antonino Esposito took the lead and arranged every morning at the breakfast to ""PASEDONO"", a hot masala tea made our every morning so wonderful.Market Place buffet also offers vegetarian food (Vegetarian counter) and Indian as well (Grill counter).Entertainment: Full marks 6 night each day 45 mins performance entertain us with world-class performances.Excursion: In and out from the port at Doha, Muscat and Khasab was very easy no additional VISA required, they provide a landing pass and that is enough.Overall experience: We just enjoyed the ship and facility provided, the only missing point was the crowd was just chilling hence not much happening at Dack 15, pool decks like what we experienced in the far east or US cruise ships.Recommendation: Must visit if it fits in your budget and time frame.",Sail Date: January 2020|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Middle East|,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"

The ship was understandably full due to the holiday season. The management, which should have anticipated the full capacity, completely failed to provide adequate support. The lines for customer service were 1 hour long. Phone calls to support desk were either unanswered or the person on the line had no idea how to answer the questions about embarkation, time change, restaurant reservations, etc.Upon check in, our friends encountered a problem with the visa. They had single entry visas to UAE and were refused the boarding as they required to have multi-entry visas. While it is passengers' responsibility to ensure they have proper visas, MSC should have prominently posted this helpful info on their website. Also, most importantly, MSC immigration staff, who are plenty at the check in, failed to provide the only possible solution to this problem, which was to go to airport to the Emirates office and have them process same-day multi-entry visa and our friends had to figure it out on their own wasting one day and joining us in Abu Dabi. Instead they were told by the MSC manager of the check in that they should fly out of the country and come back the next day and get their visas upon arrival (sounds ridiculous). We learnt that there were at least 10 families at our cruise who did not make it to the cruise altogether because of the visa situation (we were told it has been happening with EVERY cruise departing from Dubai). That part left a very unpleasant aftertaste for the whole group.The food was not great at all. The buffet was super crowded and impossible to navigate. We only once ate at the dinner restaurant - they gave us early dining time, even though we specifically requested a later option when we booked the cruise. The host/manager was dismissive about the dining time stating that this was all he had available and there was nothing he could do. The waiters did not speak good English and we got cheese instead of tea, wrong main course and on top of it my allergy (of which I clearly informed the waiter) was addressed by adding extra of the allergen to my food. The specialty restaurants were certainly better than included options. The steak house was great, their wine choices were good. French restaurant had decent menu but disastrously long wait time - 1 hour 20 minutes for the main course. Sushi good too, with nice options and good quality food.Three places that I really liked were chocolate store, juice bar and adult only bar on top of the ship. Chocolate store made really good coffee and chocolate alcohol drinks. Juice bar had great healthy options of juices and smoothies. An adult only bar had exotic and good-tasting drinks which you could not find anywhere else on the ship.Now back to management, and I hope someone in charge reads this. The staff was not trained. As we understood from the conversation with the waiters, for the most of them it was the first contract with the cruise company and 2nd or 3rd cruise. They were all from different countries, and there was no synergy between the staff at all. Long wait times for everything, zero flexibility or desire to ""see what they can do"", sometimes rude answers (not because they were rude genially but they were not trained properly). The same quality of service would not be tolerated on any Caribbean cruise. Good part about the cruise were the stops in Abu Dhabi and Qatar. That made up for the managerial nightmare of the ship.",Sail Date: December 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Middle East|,

Can you say these folks are money-grabbing folks?  From the time you hit the port, they are in your face trying to sell you stuff from packages, excursions, etc.  Its the worst experience to have, especially when you're looking forward to fun and relaxation on your cruise. The last thing you want is to be sold on things you don't want and didn't ask for. THIS WAS A HORRIBLE START!! The cabin was modern - can't complain. Typical cabin size with balcony. We were lucky to have a little cover over our deck which provided privacy.  If we didn't then all of the floors above could see everything.Our room attendant was very nice and conversational. Zoe did not work in our room.The food was barley okay - we did eat at the Hibachi restaurant and that was the best meal of the cruise. The chef was nice and entertaining. The food in the main dining room was nasty.  It was recycled food from the Marketplace :(Our server in the main dining was Ram.  And he was the highlight of the cruise for my family.  Very sweet and we really enjoyed his service. The marketplace was large in size but the same food every day - except for the international food section - which was small. It was disgusting to watch people touch the food and or sneeze on the food without turning their heads or walking away. I really believe with so many different cultures coming together there were different levels of manners and sanitation habits. I did like how they had several sinks in the foyer of the Marketplace where you can wash your hands before entering - and they always had staff there to give you a hand sanitizer.  Everything on this cruise SOOOOOO expensive.  Stay away from the excursions, book them yourself not through the cruise line.  The prices are way too inflated. We also had a BAD experience with the mosque and Ferrari World excursion with a HORRIBLE tour guide.  Most of the stops on this cruise are not worth seeing or paying outside of Dubai or Abu Dhabi.  And honestly, you can see them yourself.They walk around throughout your cruise trying to sell you something, drink packages especially and dining experience packages.  BUT it's such a horrible experience because all you want to do is enjoy the cruise. We were haggled on the cruise boat and in all the areas of UAE including Dubai.  It's very much a tourist crap.As for MSC, never again!!!!! Buyer BEWARE - Save your money!!!",Sail Date: December 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Middle East|,"Atlanta, Georgia"

This is certainly the case with this particular cruise ship and it’s management as every bad comment proved true.Firstly we had a Duplex suite with the Aurea experience. That was supposed to give us priority boarding with our luggage. Well we got on the ship in front of others, but the luggage didn’t. I had to make five calls before one suitcase arrived 3 hours after boarding the ship and the other two came two hours later. Reception told us there were 3,000 other people to get aboard but we had paid for priority boarding which for some reason was ignored. How can luggage about 200 yards from your cabin be separated and arrive at different intervals. Well I call that incompetence and probably cost cutting with insufficient staff to handle the job. It would be easier to be allowed to take your luggage on yourself if they find it too demanding themselves.The suite in some ways was a disappointment as although the idea of an upstairs may be a novel idea it still does not give you any privacy as every word can be heard from downstairs. We should have booked the Yacht suites but the Duplex suite seemed a good idea because of its size being larger than most of the Yacht cabins. Plus do you really want to be going up and down stairs all the time! These suites are right at the front of the ship so there is a fair walk to the mostly used services. Not a bad thing if you eat a lot though!There were two televisions in this suite but only one worked for half of the cruise. It took 7 calls before someone finally came to replace it. You may think why so bothered about a TV well maybe if the weather had been good but unfortunately it rained quite a lot and various excursions were cancelled due to the bad weather forecasts. I paid extra for having 2 TV’s so one should expect both to work.  Having said that there were only 2 channels of note. BBC World News and Euro News. The rest were foreign channels and a channel for you to check your bill and things to do on the ship was useful I suppose. Movies had to be paid for at 7 euros eachIt is important to keep illnesses from spreading on board ship with hand clean dispensers in certain area’s of the ship which is good but MSC can’t afford to give you any soap for your bathrooms, you have to ask for it! How mean is that! The balcony was of a good size with a hot tub but do not expect to get much sun as there is too much of it under shade. You can go up to deck 18 which is just for Yacht/Aurea guests and so we did that. Otherwise you would be fighting for a sunbed against the usual selfish passengers that keep a towel on a bed but leave the area all the time. Why cruise companies do not stop this from happening is a mystery to us,as this is a constant complaint. It's like when you go for dinner on a formal night and you make the effort to get dressed up, but some fellow passengers decide to wear jeans/shorts,and are still allowed into the dining area when you are told you will not be, as on this cruise too! Or when you are watching a show and you are specifically told not to camcorder or take photos but someone in front of you is deaf or just chooses to ignore the request.We had choice of dining times in our package in the Lighthouse restaurant which was useful but you did not have choice were to sit apart from the first night when I asked if we could sit near a window but were told for one night only! We were placed on tables which were too close together near fellow passengers and in annoying places were people were continually going behind your seat which became irritating after a while. With regards to the food it was very average both in quantity and quality. MSC know that, and so they send staff round your table trying to get you to upgrade to a steak or fish dinner for an extra 20 euro’s.Actually we did book a meal in one of the speciality restaurants – The Butchers Cut and it proved by far to be the best meal of the cruise, a better ambience and excellent quality. It cost over £150 though and that was without drinks and a starter! I had paid for a cake and wine to be presented at the Butchers Cut for our wedding anniversary but Reception staff sent it to the wrong restaurant and we never received it. The reception staff refused to take any responsibility and said it was delivered to the Lighthouse restaurant and so it was not their fault. They said they could not give a refund as I had prepaid for the gift. Someone more senior was called and I received a credit on my account which was quite simple to do and should have been done in the first place. We appreciate that it is not easy to speak different languages on a ship but some of the staffs ability to speak English was very poor and that meant misunderstandings which leads to mistakes!The Marketplace buffet was ok, but often too crowded, but again I thought the food quality was not up to standard. Plenty of choice though. The basic drinks package was included and we used that, but any beer over six euro’s you had to pay all the price. You were pestered all the time  with staff trying to get you to buy upgraded drinks packages. The plusses - The ship is beautiful and the speciality restaurants worth a visit. The Cirque du Soleil shows were good but you had to pay for that too which included a cocktail drink but with limited choices as to what you could have. The crystal staircase is lovely and my wife enjoyed the shopping on board. The games room was worth a visit with bowling, and 4D cinema which again you had to pay for.Excursions - well we had stayed in Dubai for 4 days before the cruise and so we had been on a few trips to theme parks,Dubai Mall etc a lot cheaper than MSC prices.The only excursion we did book on the ship had to be cancelled due to bad weather!To sum up if you are very easy going then this cruise line is for you. If you have been on quite a few cruises and are prepared to pay a little more for better food and service then I would think very carefully before booking with MSC as you will  probably be very disappointed when you start to compare it with other cruise lines. MSC need to seriously take a look at what they offer to their new customers because they will not get the repeat business if they do not change and listen to constructive criticism.  People do not want to be bombarded with photo/drinks or food upgrades on a continual basis.  However if anyone wishes to go on an MSC cruise our advice would be do not bother if you cannot afford Yacht class, and even then it still may not be a good idea.",Sail Date: December 2019|Cabin Type: Suite|Type of Trip: |Destination: Middle East|,"Leeds, United Kingdom"

The food wasn’t the best and it seemed more suitable for children, especially if you want something to eat late at night. The alcoholic beverages were not well prepared and I had to return a few as they were either way too sweet or tart with barely any alcohol.

We went along to the lift area where the metal cages were piled high with cases and only 2 guys to sort them out. We managed to get our cases, fancy having to do that on a crusie!

We looked forward for over a year to a beautiful new ship and watched the progress of its construction. Sadly the anticipation was the best part. Bellissima is a huge ship that crams in as many cabins and people at the sacrifice of public areas. There are never enough seats in the public areas although there are tables available, the lack of seats makes it difficult to find a spot. The deck chairs around the main pool are crammed in and always seemed to be reserved even though this is supposed to be a no no. The main pool deck 15 has the smoking area so it stinks of cigarettes. There is always entertainment there, if you call it that, and games with only a dozen or so participants at all times. It’s very loud and in your face, so a quiet time around the pool is not possible. The other very small pool at the rear is better but again lacks seating. The music here is over loud speakers and could be softer. There’s a bar here but again lack of seating and also a smoking area. Bar staff overall on the ship are rude or indifferent, and lack the necessary skills to operate a bar. The bars are also lacking in seating, with so many guests onboard and nowhere to sit. The so called adults only bar was out of order at least twice when we tried that one, and one of the bars only had drinks above our drinks package. Now regarding the drinks package. We bought the easy package a year out from the cruise. We have friends who sailed earlier this year on another MSC ship who were able to have drinks up to €6.50......so they happily had Jameson’s on their cruise with no problem at any bar. MSC are very misleading in their description of the packages and describe a selection of spirits, cocktails and wines. We were aware that the beers included were Heineken and found also Amstel light, which is ok. The selection of spirits however is bottom shelf Bells whisky, Vodka, Gin and bottom shelf Rum. No bourbon, which is my drink. All of the decent drinks were €6.50 but our package was up to €6.00 and no exception. We can only assume that MSC have changed that between the time of our friends cruise and ours. The cocktails aren’t cocktails, they are mixers like G&T and Vodka and orange, but we did find a way around it. If you are stuck on the easy drinks buy your non alcoholic cocktails and a shot of rum etc with the mixer separate and just mix it in! When we questioned the drinks package all they were interested in is upgrading your package for an exorbitant amount of money. We would’ve been better off paying as we go. Bar manager Tafseer Said did his best to rectify our issues with the bar and whenever he saw us he always checked that things were ok. Chocolate bar a huge waste of space that could be better accommodated with, say a lounge area, as lots of chocolate on display but no one in here buying. The massive casino is just another attempt at making money and could’ve been a quarter of the size as hardly anyone using it. Obviously an indoor smoking area which was offensive. Again that would’ve given more nice public area. No library or place to have a quiet read. Cirque Du Soleil was a amateurish performance and the so called cocktails were a choice of non alcoholic mai tai, gin and tonic or rum and something. NOT COCKTAILS as described and they were awful with most people not drinking them. Dining.....we didn’t eat in the animal farm buffet although did a walk through a couple of times. As a Coeliac I needed to eat in the main restaurants. A plus is that this is a Coeliac certified ship with a Gluten Free kitchen. I was served only by the head waiter at all times and every effort was made to accommodate this without exception. Yoseph in the the main dining and Marcelo at breakfast. I usually skipped lunch but on one occasion did use the restaurant for lunch. We found the service slow here and they charged for a bottle of wine rather than a glass on our package. My advice is to keep track of the charges as there were a few mistakes made and other guests had the same issue. The evening meals were nice but towards the latter part of the trip they became mundane. Service however by Greisy Maria in the main dining room was excellent. If you are Coeliac you will have no worries here. My only issue is that the buffet could have some dry pre packaged crackers gluten free so that a light lunch with, say cheese and lettuce could be had. On the Hurtigruten line this was accomodated. I do carry my own rice crackers however and I would recommend doing this.The cabins are a little smaller than the MSC Poesia which we have sailed on before, but quite comfortable. It’s strange but on a new ship things like the lounge looked really old and I can’t help but wonder that it may have been fitted out with things from another ship, maybe having a refurb? Bathroom a little small esp for larger people but quite adequate. Shower was nice and hot with a good amount of pressure, . We are both small so it wasn’t any great issue for us.The cabin boy was warm friendly but needs more training. Lots of dust that wasn’t attended to both in the cabin and bathroom and on a few occasions I had to leave a note to replenish the soap. No big issue though. Beds were always well made and comfortable. We were on deck 11 in a balcony room and had a little verandah with two chairs. One major flaw is that they don’t provide Kleenex tissues in the room!!!! Now this may seem mundane but when you have to waste your time in ports looking for a supermarket to buy tissues then it’s an issue. Even a lowly two star hotel motel provides tissues, so a beautiful new ship not providing them is ridiculous. Is this their way of cost cutting? The cabins are built with a slot for them and there were many complaints about it. We had to use toilet paper when we ran out of our own......really poor! The entertainment in the theatre was, for the most part, quite good except for Daniel mime! I’m sorry for the artist but it was terrible. A children’s matinee would’ve been more professional. Lots of people walked out, including us. We gave him a second chance another night but it was equally awful. I felt embarrassed for him. The opera was boring as the songs weren’t known songs as expected. Most of the shows we’re pretty good though. Again the lack of public areas was an issue after the show there was nowhere that you could get a seat for a drink. Very crowded and few seats. This ship is very poorly designed and this view was shared by many guests of more than one nationality. One English lady said “For a beautiful new ship how do they get it so wrong?” That sums it up. There were long queues at guest reception at all times. Unfortunately we had occasion to complain about several issues including returning to our cabin one night to find someone’s luggage in our room. This was met flippantly with a ....it’s not your luggage question..... when my husband went to reception about it there was a very distressed Italian man gesticulating about his lost luggage and when my husband approached, the staff member gave him the hand and said he’s busy, upon which my husband said if this is about luggage, then I have it! The public area toilets weren’t serviced well with a lack of soap and toilet paper. Hand sanitizer wasn’t enforced esp when entering food areas. I remember on the Poesia there were staff at the entries making sure this was done. Had occasion to speak to the Voyagers club woman. What a rude pig of a woman she is. Excursions were disorganised with us finding ourselves on mixed language buses even thought we were at the meeting point well before time. Other English speaking were on English speaking buses so we looked like we were the leftovers. Annoying. Also the timing was ridiculous with our bus always last even though all guests were onboard. In Muscat we were half hour past the time of the Mosque being open because of this. Rome Baroque tour was good with a good guide. We didn’t see Marseille as apparently weather didn’t permit docking although the weather appeared fine and sunny. We docked at Toulon instead which is a little village. Nice enough but not Marseilles. Some people had booked independent tours in Marseilles so they forfeited. Whilst the MSC excursions are more expensive and not always fantastic, we felt that it’s a safer option as if there are any issues like this the MSC are liable. Khasab is a total waste of a day. There is nothing here except a few shops all with the same stuff, and all run by Indians. It’s a grotty little nothing. Don’t know why they even dock here. We had a long stop and yet a port like Heraklion we only had four hours. The queue to re board at Khasab was two hours standing in the sun as they only had three tenders operating for five thousand people. Tempers were frazzled to say the least. Unfortunately for us we are booked on MSC again next year but only seven days. We traveled on MSC Poesia in 2011 and this was a good experience compared to Bellissima.On the basis of this cruise, had we not already booked, we will never use MSC again.",Sail Date: November 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Middle East|,"Gold Coast, Australia"

The areas on the ship were kept lovely and clean. Staff were all very friendly. The only reason I haven't given 5 stars is because the food was awful. My husband got a burger from the snack bar which was raw in the middle. The food in the restaurant was very limited in choice and for two days we didn't bother to eat as we just couldn't face it.

Beautiful ship and great crew but that's where the positives end. We waited for 3 hours for embarkation which was an absolute shambles. Once on the ship it was announced the boat drill would be in 5minutes.  How can you have a boat drill while people are still boarding. The entertainment was non existent. All they wanted to do was teach you to dance .The bands in the bars were boring all playing the same sort of dance music. Best bar was Masters of the Sea with great staff and a chap on the quitar.The shows were ok but i'm sure a couple of them should have been children's entertainers.Never have we paid for water in a restaurant but with MSC you do.

The Staff and crew are  disorganised and poorly trained in there jobs.  They have no customer service skills at all.  Most looked like they didn't want to be in the job and were reluctant to talk or smile and it came across as they were  only there to get paid and tour the world. Not at all helpful in any way.From the time we arrived at the port with the embarkation disorganisation we hoped it would improve but sadly it got worse.When we finally got on the ship no one was  there to tell us where our cabin was and we had difficulty finding it. When we made it to the room we were impressed by the cabin.  It was clean and spacious.We requested early dining and even on our documentation we  printed out before we left home it stated early dining at 5.30 pm ...only to find when we arrived we had been allocated 7.45 dining.  We went to the restaurant and requested to change and was told there were no vacancies yet other members of our party were given the earlier time..no questioned asked.We were surprised that you had to pay for still water in dining rooms...Never had this before..surely for customer relations MSC could afford a glass of water with meals.On three occasions in the dining room the meal was not edible but if we went to buffet they closed at 8.30 and all that was available was pizza. My husband asked for french fries the second night of the cruise and every night he received fries no other vegetables even though we said no fries. Then they started giving me fries as well which I said no too but received them anyway..Our cabin was cleaned daily, the bed made and bins emptied but the lid of the bin was dirty with spilt soft drink when we arrived and was still spotty on day 17 so not cleaned at all.Our balcony was only cleaned once during whole ship balcony cleaning.  On other occasions the top decks were being cleaned and water was cascading down onto our balcony so we had to close the doors and stay inside.We were charged movie fees for movies which we didn't use and when we went to guest services and said we didn't use this facility and the girl , who was very rude, said we must have.  We said we flicked through the titles but she insisted that we had confirmed the movies.  WE know we didn't and then after much discussion she said she would delete it but next time we would have to pay no matter what...So we turned the TV off and didn't use it again.  As for Zoe that was a complete waste of time.  Very limited responses.There were no tissues available in the cabins which surprised us as with the amount of clients that had coughs and colds on board.  The buffet was a nightmare there was no hygiene at the doors and people were coming in from toilets etc to food.unacceptable...The Europeans on board were terrible for picking up food with their fingers from the buffet and putting it on their plates then returning it to the buffet if they saw something they liked better further along the line. There was no one available to monitor the buffet lines.The buffet closed at 8-8.30 each night which was crazy considering there were over 4500 passengers on board..Surely it can be left open to say 10.00pm.The entertainment was average and it is the first time we have ever had to book and pay for the entertainment.On sea days there was nothing to do unlike other lines.  The pool deck staff spoke in Spanish or Italian all the time and for us english only speaking we had no idea what was going on.MSC Tours...What can we say...very expensive for what was provided. Our introduction to Dubai tour was a shambles. We had a bus trip through some very ordinary streets ,Museum with about 500 people crammed into a confined space, a mosque which we were informed we couldn't go inside as  MSC didn't have enough time to organise that component then a quick trip back to the ship.  a 4-4.30 hour tour with us leaving the port at 3.30 and returning before 7 pm.  We lined up at shore excursions for over 30 mins to complain and  didnt get served so cut our losses and left.  Others in our group got the hop on hop off bus outside the port and had all day for less cost.So make sure you check costs of outside tours before booking with MSC...most if not all ports had taxis and mini buses etc. Prices for all were about half the cost of MSC.The day before we left the ship I had Euros which I hadn't spent and went to guest services to pay off our account. At NO Time was I told that the account would be closed.The staff on the disembarking station were rude as well every time we left the ship and came back we were met with a very gruff grab of the card (snatching) and he would throw it back at us...it became a joke between the passengers as to how hard he could snatch and throw the cruise card at us......not good.... On leaving the ship on the 30th we got to the exit and my card brought up a RED screen and the person said I couldn't leave the ship until I had paid the Account...I was very embarrassed as he said it so loud and every one in the line heard but he didn't say that only 12.25 Euros that was owed. WE had signed a pre authorization form in our check in and assumed that this covered any balance owing when we left the ship..NO ...So we had to go back to guest services to pay the balance. We waited over 1/2 hour to be served( with all the new passengers the queues were very long)..We were  served by a young boy who spoke very little english and had no idea and kept saying as we were new passengers we had to authorise our credit card.  After getting very impatient trying to explain we were leaving the ship and had a pre authoration for our credit card to be debited with the balance owing...I asked to speak to someone else and then waited another 17 mins until someone else came. we were told that because we paid some of the balance in cash it had cancelled the pre authorisation. Why bother with pre authorisation if it doesn't work. I was told to pay balance but they wouldn't take Australian or American dollars which was all i had. After waiting more time finally someone in the office saw some sense and pressed a button and reactivated the pre authorisation of my credit card.  We were  told that we should have been told that this scenario would happen...again lack of staff training and customer service skills.Needless  to say we missed our transfer and had extra costs with taxis etc...I am sure that there will be lots of negative feedback from this cruise as every one we spoke to had numerous complaints ..there was no atmosphere on board, the staff unhappy and rude, the MSC line was out to money grab on every opportunity available...All in all a horrible cruise and very disappointing as we were looking forward to it so much..I would have like and  expect MSC to compensate us for having to deal with all the problems we encountered but we will NOT hear from MSC  again...They have our money..and don't careAs for recommending MSC to our friends NO...we will be telling them the truth....For one bad experience the customer will tell ten people ...I will be telling my network which is extensive...through facebook , trip advisor and cruise critic as well a letter will be forwarded to MSC head office.We will not be cruising with MSC again...MSC NOT FOR ME",Sail Date: November 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Middle East|,Australia

We did not experience any apart from embarkation day and just once.We opted for an angle balcony Aurea Suite with jacuzzi on the balcony. Unfortunately out of the 7 days, we could not use the Jacuzzi on 3 days. 1. Cleaning balcony day. You are advised to close balcony doors and curtains from a day before. They then open all balconies to form one long corridor. Our balcony was accessed but not cleaned at all. 2. for some odd reason we found our jacuzzi empty on the last evening (possibly for cleaning before the next guests). 3, On our second day, without being advised, the upper decks were being power washed resulting in almost 2 hours of constant water raining on our balcony. Also the water got very smelly from day 3. We informed cabin Stewart who came, saw the clean filter warning and just emptied part of it and refilled. Left same filter and we were left with the clean filter warning for the rest of the Cruise (though the smell was much less).We had a 14 year old with us and we only received a teen programme on the last full day of the Cruise (day at sea). We had no idea what was happening as the on-board daily programme only had one daily entry for teens so we thought it was weak like the rest of the daily programme. Probably the daily onboarding/sisembarkation/Safety meetings have a toll on the crew who are unable to plan/organise other activities.Yes MSC on-boards and disembarks passengers daily so every day from 16:00 you start hearing very loud constant reminders in 7 languages asking passengers who just embarked to attend the compulsory security info meeting at 16:30. This lasts around 45 minutes. I had a massage booked at 16:30 and the experience was ruined with 30 mins of loud notices and safety info with a speaker directly above my head in the small massage room. The masseuse offered me to change the time but the other available slots were not convenient for us.Casino is nice with some very good machines and bar service but I could not stay more than 15 minutes with all the smoking going on everywhere. There were some no smoking signs but no enforcement at all. Unlike NCL (as an example) there are no light snacks here so if you are up to a light night snack check the time as the buffet place closes at 10 and reopens for 2 hours midnight to 2am with some light snacks and pizza.WIFI was weak. None at all from our bedroom. The 'MSC for me' app is great but requires the free ship WIFI connection which only allows you access to the app unless you pay extra for actual internet data. Zoe, the cabin assistant (to the likes of Google Home and Alexa) is still a waste of desk space. It answers very few questions and mainly asks you to consult your daily programme, TV channels and the MSC for Me app. Plus if you are used to other voice home assistants, please be patient with this one as it is very slow to get back with an answer. However it has great potential and I can see this as a trend setter for other lines and even hotels.For food we mainly used the Market Place Buffet for the reasons below and food was average except for the day at sea were it was evidently better with more choice and the only time that the buffet had decent deserts of a decent size.We only used the Poseidon for breakfast once. Miserable portions and choice and we got 1 of 3 orders wrong. Also asked for fresh orange juice and the reply was ""not included"" in our ""all inclusive"" drink package which should include all drinks upto EUR 6. How expensive could a fresh orange juice be?We used our assigned Dinner restaurant twice (Light House). Again miserable portions. They got the food we ordered but managed to deliver all to the wrong person (just 3 of us). Mistakes were a constant. At least it was funny and we were betting on the next mistake :). Also too many waiters with different responsibilities. One for bread, one for water, one for wine, another for other drinks and one for food. So you ask the water waiter for a soft drink and says ""my colleague"" will be with you shortly but never comes :). Also Waiters get confused and you get asked your cabin room number over and over.Its a pity as these restaurants are very well staffed (probably too many) whilst the buffet (which gets overcrowded as many prefer it to the restaurants) is very much understaffed and to get a drink you have to wait too long. I usually preferred to go myself to the bar, but just 2 barman (at times 1) dealing with all the clients and the drinks waiters who also wait at the bar to get their ordered drinks is too much to handle.Under staffing in bars is also very evident and at times it feels like this is on purpose to minimise consumption as many a times one gives up waiting.We loved the evening shows. Great life music, amazing dancers and singers. Great detail to costumes and scenography. There was a shadows performer on one night who is pretty good but so much full of himself :). His show starts with a 2 minute video of his performances around the world to show us the standing ovations he gets.  It was like trying to convince you before the show that he is good :). The Cirque du Soleil shows are good but too short and nothing amazing when compared to other Cirque du Soleil shows we've attended elsewhere.I was also very annoyed about the 'Free 24 hour Room Service' which we should have had with the Aurea experience. We soon discovered that the choice is a shame (One menu page of light snacks and another page for pizza) and to add insult to injury the only free aspect is the delivery but food must be paid for. Can someone explain what this means? So food is free at the restaurants and the only service which I would somehow accept to pay for is the delivery which is free for Aurea. Makes no sense. Clearly a sales gimmick in the wording used. So assume the only way to get it free would be to go to the buffet, fill your plates from the free food then ask a waiter to deliver to your room. Would that be free? ridiculous.Same with the free as much as you want 'gelato'.  There is an amazing Gelateria (Ice cream parlour) on the ship but this is none of its ice creams are included in the free gelato package. The only ice cream included is the one by the pool deck from the soft ice cream machine.Also reception people have no clue. The 'MSC for Me' is advertised to offer family members with a position tracking on the ship and a chat facility between people you share your ID with. The reception said that we need a special arm bend which needs to be purchased for the tracking and chat. We asked 3 people and they all had no clue. However we managed to make the chat work throughout the cruise with some trial and error. I told the reception about this at a next visit and they were surprised.Also I went to the reception 3 times to ask if we could have a late (12:00) disembarkation as we had a late flight. Why 3 times? Because it was evident that they were making up their own rules. We had an Aurea Suite so I was given the impression we had some choice in this. I got 3 Different answers from 3 different reception staff:1. ""Sorry latest you can stay in room is 8am and latest on ship is 10am. Not any longer""2. ""You must vacate room at 8am but I will make a note to give you black tags on last day so you can disembark 11:30 (On the last night we got blue tags with disembarkation at 8:30am)""3. ""Do not take out your luggage on the last night so you bring them down to the ""hand luggage"" desk in the morning, by latest 8am. Then you can stay on the ship till latest 12:00 but we cannot help you with the luggage and you cannot reenter the room after 8am.""We decided to follow the instruction of number 3 as it was the closest to our wishes.

As it was only a short cruise we booked Yacht Club (YC) and were certainly not disappointed.Even as YC guests, check in at Barcelona was chaotic but we were soon onboard. All YC rooms are forward and guests have their own private access area. Room was large and airy with decent size balcony and plenty of storage space - room mini bar content (replenished daily) was included in our rate and being gold card MSC members we also had a complimentary bottle of fizz and large fruit bowl waiting for us. Handy usb chargers on both sides of the bed but not well placed and fiddly to access. Bathroom had a slight “Mediterranean whiff” but not a problem with the door closed. There’s a large shower area with good water pressure. Bit annoying having to vacate rooms by 0800hrs on departure day and cases have to be ready for collection outside door by 0100hrs.  However, there’s no pressure to leave the ship (not sure if it’s the same for non YC guests) - we had breakfast and stayed in the lounge until ready to disembark around midday.YC member lounge and restaurant have unobstructed views over front of the ship and there’s also a deck on the 19th floor with small pool, hot tub, bar and sunbeds.  All YC staff were friendly, happy to engage in conversation and provided exemplary service.  There was a formal evening on one night but no strict dress code - so no need to pack a tux unless you feel the need.  We did try the main buffet once at lunchtime and have to say it was manic and noisy compared to the YC oasis of calm - guests piling plates high, pushing and shoving, waiters trying to up sell drink packages etc and canteen style seating.As we were only onboard for a two night duration, most of it was spent cocooned within the YC environment.

Considering the ship is only a few months old we were surprised regarding the wear on the main handrails on the stairways and the state of the carpets in the same area. We did  think the restaurant  meals were very good with a very good choice and  good service.Special mention to( eko prasetyo andi) in the il ciliegio restaurant who we believe went that extra mile to give us a very good service. We also went to the buffet a few times and again found this to be very good with a  bewildering choice (they even make there own  mozzarella balls) yes it does get busy but we never had any issuesThis ship would probably not appeal to traditional cruise enthusiasts,as MSC have aimed for a different  type of clientele, which works well considering the various nationalities that we came across on the ship and the presentations being spoken in numerous languages.In the daily planner they have a suggested dress code casual, white, elegant or tropical.Some people do dress up some do not it's not enforced its just suggested.  Now depending on where you choose to board the ship (you seem to be able to board in most ports) the elegant night could end up being the last night !!.Which can be tricky considering you have to put your cases out by 1pm although it wasn't a problem for us.We saw both the cirque du soleil shows and thought  them to be very good, quite a loose story but very good musically and theatrical  we believe these should not to be missed. They do give you a choice of made up cocktails but these may not appeal to everyone.We also saw a selection of the other shows while on the ship, again we thought these were very good.One of the highlights for us was the dome shows, they have an LCD screen with changing displays in the middle of the ship and most nights put on shows there with lively music, completely different to anything we have seen before and definitely something not to be missed. There are numerous bars on board the ship including a Masters of the Sea British pub which served various types of beer, and even cider.Our favourite was the edge bar on deck six (special mention to Arry and all  the bar staff there ) and the infinity bar on deck 5 (special mention to evelyn)As you would expect there is quite a lot of technology used on board the ship some of this works very well some does not.We thought  the msc for me app worked very well even has a GPS built in in case you get lost on the ship!!The interactive screens were also very good showing where you were on the ship, we found these  useful as well.Such a good idea of the usb's in the bedside lamps.We had high hopes for Zoe but unfortunately could not get her to work which was a great pity.  To sum up Go with an open mind, this ship is appealing to a different type of cruiser, probably people who would not normally go on a cruise and a younger generation, but also likes some aspects of  traditional cruising experience as well.We would have no hesitation in booking another cruise on board the MSC Bellissima.PortsMarseilleAll the cruise ships dock quite a good distance out of the townSo if you want to get out and about you only have limited choices We opted  to walk to get the Free shuttle 10/15mins depending  on where you dock (follow the green line to white tent ) (buses about every half an hour ish )Then took about 25 mins to Place de la Jolette. You are then still about 1/2 an hour to 3/4 quarters of an hour walk in to the main harbour. The ship also offers a shuttle service for approximately 16 euros each from ship to city centre which takes about ½ hour.There are metro/bus options as well (from Place de la Jolette)We thought the harbour was quite a nice place to walk round, nice shopping mall called Center Bourse.Just before you go back through the gate to get the  return shuttle  bus there is an even better mall on the right called Les Trerrasses Du Port  which has a very good selection of  shops. GenoaThe ship docks close to the centre The main harbour /marina and shops are to the rightIf it is a nice day then a visit to a place called is Boccadasse is worth itBus 18 to piazza giuseppe verdi which seems to be opposite genova brignole train station   (Bus stop on right on main road ) then bus 31 depending on bus times takes  about 1/2 an hour to get there.Ticket 2.5 euros each from driver for 100 mins travelWe found  google maps to be very useful The harbour area is also nice to walk along be careful of people selling bracelets!!NaplesDid not get of ship MessinaThe ship docks close to the centre, nice place to walk around again google maps very useful A sight not to be missed is the medieval clock  that puts on a show at 12 o'clock each day If you are feeling a bit more adventurous then a trip to taormina could be an optionKeep an eye out for Mount Etna when you sail out, we were fortunate  to see plumes of smoke coming out.VallettaAgain ship docks right in the centreWhen vacating ship, walk to the right you will come across the lift (cost 1 euro) approximately 500 yards past the malta souvenir mini bus (prices seem to be quite good) which will take you up to upper barrakka gardens (oddly good  wifi hotspot at rear of gardens) from there its  a short  walk into town  Again nice place to walk around Midday (12 noon) gun salute is also something else not to be missed (quite loud) it is also at 4 pmAnother attraction is St John's Cathedral, we did not go in as it was  quite a long queue.",Sail Date: October 2019|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: |Destination: Mediterranean|,"Liverpool, United Kingdom"

About 2 weeks before traveling read people's comments here, however try to travel with a clean mind and without taking into account what was written. After all, everything was already paid. I start with this: Entrance to the ship. Perfect. All very well organized and our bags arrived in the room in a second. Room with balcony, beautiful, but not like other boats, As for the food. Day 1 and 2. It was good. From day 3 until the last day, all the food was horrible. I saw how lunch steaks were offered that same day at dinner, but with mushroom sauce. The restaurant designated in the evenings, the food was not something excellent, and the service, the worst of the worst. They do you the favor of serving you, and they are stressed all the time and have no patience .... Very boring nights, you only have entrance to a show and the quality of the show is not good. In this boat, what matters to them is to sell you drinks, it is not necessary to make any package, when I wanted to drink something, I paid for it and it was not expensive. Ice cream is not free like the rest of the companies, here you have to pay and it is not cheap. In the end, Food is not good, (at least not for those of good taste), VERY BAD Service.

Check in was fine but we were late arriving so most people had boarded.  Unlike other cruises we have been with they took passengers on st every port visited. My Suitcase arrived at 4.30 but by 6 my husbands case hadn’t arrived phoned reception who said it could take till 7.  Found out our dining time was set for 6 we tried to change but were given a different dining area and set time of 6.15😩. Never encountered set dining time or set dining room before.  A terrible time as quite often back to ship was 5.30 and a rush to get back washed and ready for dinner.  Husband had to go for dinner in the same clothes he had been in since 3.30 am that day! At 9 o clock on our return from dinner still no case. Phoned reception who told us the ticket might of come off the case so my husband had to go down to reception. Found out there was a security issue with his case so then had to go to security.  They made him turn out his case nothing to be found an excuse of an apology given, arrived back to cabin about 10 o vlock, not a good start.  Cabin very nice plenty of room and quiet thank god because the buffet restaurant was like a cattle market the noise was horrendous.  Food was ok but the carvery meat was quite often very tough, but plenty of salad and nice bread. We found apart from buffet and set dining room there was nowhere else to eat without having to pay.  Staff were very mixed and some just did not want to be there, again never encountered this on any other ships. Getting back on ship was a nightmare at the first 3 stops as security took for ever, also no welcome drink or cold towel or staff welcoming you back on board 😩, something we always had on RC, NCL and Celebrity ships so quite a dissapointed by. The excursions were very overpriced so check ‘What’s in Port before you go gives you tips about costs etc, if there are free shuttles or much lower shuttles than the cruise ship offers.  Do your research before you go, it pays off.  The other problem we had was my husband was eating a piece of cake in the buffet restaurant and bit into something hard it was a slim piece of metal about 3/4 inch long, told waiter who informed his manager. Manager came over asked for our cabin number no apology and we never heard another cheep. If this had got lodged in his throat he could of choked and if it had been a child I dread to think! Entertainment was ok but mainly done by resident staff so no real professional shows.  Drinks package was another one several different ones and we eventually found out from a very helpful waiter what ours included.  Cheapest package was drinks up to 6 dollars, not a lot of choice as most drinks started at 6.50 dollars no ice cream either.  A lot of people only found this out when they handed over there card to be told they would have to pay for there ice cream, a bit embarrassing for them. All in all a lot of things that MSC could quite easily rectify if they looked at the reviews that people write, would pay them to employ a customer relations person on their ships.  It is a very competitive market out there and if MSC want to be one of the major leaders they need to sit up and take notice of what it’s customers are saying. We won’t be sailing with MSC again and we wouldn’t recommend anyone to sail with them either.  😩👎",Sail Date: August 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Mediterranean|,"Dumfries and Galloway, United Kingdom"

And there were no MSC staff on duty when we did arrived.Luckily, the Port Authority staff had just “booked off” but stayed behind (without pay) to sought out the problem.Within 2 hours, MSC had booked us into the Novotel, and a plane flight from Milan to Naples to pick up the cruse a day late, which meant we missed out on the excursion to Pompeii.However, the crew of the Bellissma made up for the disappointment as best they could with Moet Champaign, chocolates and a substantial financial compensation in Euros as a credit to use on the cruise and as cash if we didn't use it all.It turned out to be a great cruise.",Sail Date: September 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Mediterranean|,"Brisbane, Australia"

After remortgaging we decided to take a holiday, and after being shown a programme featuring the sister ship, I knew this was would be a good first step into the world of cruising.  Plus, I hate flying and this cruise was perfect as I could get a train from London to Marseille and board there.We had the Aurea experience, which among other things gave us priority boarding.  Although she's a beast of a ship with around 5,000 passengers, it's like a hop-on, hop-off tour, so the queues weren't that bad for embarkation, but if they offer priority, who am I to turn it down?!As we boarded there was quite a hustle for upselling photos, excursions and meal plans, but we had already booked in advance everything we wanted.The balcony cabin, 13046, was immaculate.  Maybe a bit small for a family of four but as it was our first we had nothing to compare it to.  Clean and tidy and well laid out.  Zoe was useless but it's emerging technology so it gets a pass.  No cardboard do not disturb hangars, just a nice switch which puts a discreet light on above the door.  Main bed seemed huge and was very comfortable.Wandering around the ship it was very easy to get lost.  So many floors, so many lifts.  eventually we found our way round.Dining in the Marketplace buffet wasn't as bad as some reviews make out.  Yes it can seem busy but if you go for a wander you'll easily find a table.  There's even a service button on the tables to order drinks from the bar.  Having an inclusive drinks package I did this on several occasions, and no one judged me for having a pint at 7am so kudos to the staff.Again with the Aurea package we had easy dining, which meant there was always a table reserved for us in the Posidonia restaurant; not only for the four of us but because we travelled with my in-laws, even though they were on a lower package they still held a table for six.Food in Posidonia was amazing, both breakfast and evening.  No other words for it.My kids, 14 and ten both enjoyed the pools.  I used the water slides once but as we were still in dock it dawned on me that I was climbing a ladder 18 storeys high and I lost my nerve so I retired to the bar soon after.The sports bar area had most of the child-friendly activities.  Most of these were extra cost, and quite pricey, but I bought a fun pass before we boarded, which gave us EUR180 credit for £90.  The F1 simulators were EUR10 per person, the VR maze 15 so it really helped make these activities affordable.  We also did the 4D cinema which was a good laugh but I can't remember off hand how much that was.  The fun pass could be used in the arcade but not on the side show machines.We also bought the digital photo pass for £80 and that gave us online copies of all the photos taken on board.  I think we came away with getting close to 100 photos, some of them came out really well.The excursions: We booked three with MSC, again online: Genoa aquarium (behind the scenes), Sorrento & Pompeii, and Etna (we had booked the Etna kids' club but they didn't have enough English speaking guests to justify it, so we had a refund and a 10% discount on the standard one).Genoa: The behind the scenes was quite interesting but I don't think personally we saw ""enough"" background.  Nice little boat trip both ways and plenty of free time after the guided tour ended.Sorrento and Pompeii: Too much travelling.  Our tour guide was good and enthusiastic but due to traffic and scheduling, we only had an hour in Sorrento (MUST SEE: Limonoro), and after being herded through the coral shop outside Pompeii, had no free time in the historic site, even missing the souvenir shop!Etna: Again two and a half hours on a coach, for only one hour of free time to see the  Silvestri craters. Yet we were back on ship before 3pm- why not get us back later and give us more time?  We would have had time then to use the cable car.  As it was we only managed the larger of the two craters, have a pee and a pint in the bar.Captain's night was more Gala night, Cap posed for pictures (obviously) near the Swarovski staircases but there wasn't really anything apart from the photo opportunities and everyone else all dolled up.White party didn't start until 11pm and I was too tired for that; why start such a pivotal event so late after everything on during the day?The ship had no duty-free shop on board, just Malta.  Malta was a fantastic place for little Englanders like myself.  So friendly, but beautiful weather and scenery, and everything was so cheap.  We bought tickets for the barracks for the lunchtime saluting battery, two adults and two kids cost a measly 8 euros.  A small can of local lager was only 2.50 too.  Yes you can watch the battery for free, but we were stood less than 10 feet from the cannon.  There was a talk before the firing too that you wouldn't get without paying.  Baccy in the duty free shop was 16 Euros for 5 packs (50g GV) so ridiculously cheap.We paid the extra for both Cirque Du Soleil shows, we went for the 14 Euro drink option instead of the meal.  The cocktails were a bit flat; poured in advance, and I didn't like shepherding my kids through the casino, but the shows were brilliant.  Same as the evening entertainment; very short, but I can understand that they have to do multiple sittings in order to give everyone a chance to see them.  Shows, along with restaurants can be booked at any of the many touch-screen information panels throughout the ship.I've hinted throughout this review but now it's to what I consider the most important thing: the bars.There's loads.I mean, LOADS.On our sea day, starting with the Marketplace Buffet, I managed to visit 18 DIFFERENT establishments.  I borrowed my sons' iPad and used it to edit my photos whilst crawling form bar to bar.  Some places I had more than one (I liked the Negroni in the Bellissima bar, and the Aperol Spritz in the Sports Bar, all included with my Aurea package).  I think the only places I didn't get a drink at were restaurants I wasn't assigned to and the Yacht Club bars.  I have a list and photos of them all because I wasn't sure if I'd remember them!This brings me on to the one thing that made this holiday.Masters Of The Sea.Alfredo, Eduardo and Francesco made us feel so welcome from day one.  It was the friendliest, most welcoming and entertaining bar I think I've ever been in.  They remembered our names the first time we walked in, and our orders.  Not a day went past where we didn't drop in ,and not a day were we not made welcome. I didn't even realise I like olives until I was given several bowls to snack on.The MSC for me app sort of works, but there is no push notification when you receive a message, and if you register your child as a child they block the messaging, which seems ridiculous as the ship is one of the biggest man-made moving things ever created and surely asking the kids where they are wouldn't hurt?Yes there were other guests that weren't aware of the concept of queuing, or indeed talking with ""indoor voices"", but that is out of MSC's control.I feel like I'm missing something but honestly it was the best part of an incredible holiday, one that I didn't want to end (the cruise I mean, Disneyland can go Eff itself!)",Sail Date: August 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Mediterranean|,"Bristol, United Kingdom"

I don't think that the ship catered effectively for this number of people. The buffet restaurant was like a cattle market, you had to keep walking round and round until a table was free, the food was ok but it was more ""canteen"" rather than restaurant quality.The ship also caters more for Continental customers as Irish and British people, also some fellow passengers were extremely rude and didnn't seem to understand the concept of queueing.The food in the complementary restaurant was of a good quality, the staff at our table were really nice. The staff overall were very friendly and obliging and the cabins were nice although the balcony was a bit on the small side. The partition on the side of our balcony came loose on 1 night and completely collapsed on another.The entertainment was ok but again didn't cater for the numbers. We generally had to hang around ""quiet"" bars and pick up empty chairs as they became free as there were 4 of us.Everything on board is geared towards making more money, the minute you embark you are bombarded with ""offers"" for drinks and speciality restaurant packages.

It took us less than 10 minutes to arrive at our cabin.We booked a cabin with balcony Bella experience.The cabin was very clean and we were greated by our attendant -Mr.Edwin- who did a great job during the cruise.The only inconvenience was that the cabin is situated under the restaurant and sometimes it may be a littles noisy but acceptable.Out attendant was always present and the towels were changed  on regular basis .The ship is very elegant and all the areas are clean.The Swarovski stairs and the reception area are amazing; the music in the lobby is of quality and entertaining.We were assigned to Posidonia restaurant and opted for the 21.45 dinner. We had dinner every night at Posidonia and breakfast only on the day at sea, because we booked trips in each port and breakfast at Marketplace buffet was more rapid. Our waiter at Posidonia -Mr. Putera was very friendly and efficient. Some of the reviewers complained about the portions but it is a restaurant a la carte.Anyway we found the food more than enough and there is always the option of Marketplace open 20 hours. At the entry at Marketplace restaurant there are provided facilities to wash hands and sanitizer.The food was faultless on both and very variated.There are plenty of fruits and sweets.At breakfast there are many juices and fresh juices, umlimited coffee and water all day.We were received on the 1st day with a welcome at bord cake.The people at pizzas are working continously and the pizzas are delicious.Entertainement was amazing; plenty of activities for all tastes and ages.We enjoyed the dome shows, Cirque du soleil Varelia and the shows at London theatre.There are plenty of entertainment at Atmosphere pool non-stop.The white party was pleasant and everybody enjoyed it.The same for the gala night :it was amazing.Every night when we came back from dinner the program for the next day was in our cabin.We booked in each port the excursions from MSC; at Naples :Pompeii, At Messina: Etna, at Malta: Mdina and Valleta tour, City tour in Barcelona and a trip to Aix-en-Provence in Marseille. Back to Genoa we booked a trip to Portofino since our flight was at 7PM and the reception helped us to leave our bags at the terminal.Contrary to some negative reviews I have to admit that they are excellent organizers, we left on time( and at some excursions were more than one bus for English speakers) and we were back on the ship on time.The trips were very pleasant and the guides very professional .I have to mention the most amazing guides ever we had : Mr Aldo in Messina ( an enciclopedy of history and botany and with an entertaining sense of humor) and Mrs. Bernadette in Malta.We were lucky to have you as our guides.There are plenty of activities for children and teenagers; nice experience the Formula 1 simulation.The welcome at board photo is printed only if you are asking for it at 19,90 euros.The photographers at bord are not pushy and they take you photos only if you agree.Gratuities on bord are 10 euros /day; which I foud very fair considering the quality of services provided and the excellent staff.Galleria Bellissima is very pleasant to shop and every day there are half-price deals .There are many restaurants where you can have lunch or dinner .Very strict rules for the passenger to attend emergency training.Also very useful training on disembarking from the ship and very organized.We realy had an amazing holiday and we will book in the future with MSC cruises.",Sail Date: September 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Mediterranean|,"Amman, Jordan"

We were also restricted to 6.15pm dining time which meant a dash back from the days' sightseeing.The ship offers shuttle bus services at Barcelona and this was grossly overpriced 10 euros for a 10 minute trip.

A few niggles - but that's lazy isn't it? There was far more good than bad. Our first cruise so nothing to compare against and be disappointed by. Cabin felt roomy enough. Storage generous and we didn't use it all. Kept clean by the lovely Fransisco who did a fab job several times a day. Good attention to hygiene throughout the ship. Food perfectly acceptable in buffet. Didn't feel the need to eat anywhere else all week. Didn't bother with drinks package and it worked out fine. Mostly needed water during the week and that's free for everyone. Tea fine too. Biggest disappointment for us was lego at the kids club because adults not allowed and when our children did want to do it, it wasn't available because the club were so swamped with other passengers dumping their kids that they had to do organised events to cope. Pools very busy and very noisy with music and events. Main pool closes at 8pm. Lots of lounger hogging and staff not enforcing threat to remove pool towels. Pool towels supplied by ship and can be taken ashore for beaches. Waterpark fun but long queues. No where for adults to sit and supervise at waterpark.  Need a seating and de-robing area really. Ship itself stunning and the operation to run it so smoothly is staggeringly impressive. LED Dome breathtaking at times. Dome shows everynight for 5 minutes worth going to see. Saw several shows. Decent quality and production with some real talent. Bit like end of term stage school productions every night. Circle de Soleil 15 euros extra per person for cocktail and show or more for dinner. Can't just see it for free. Good show (slow starting for me) but not sure it and the cocktail are worth 15 euros. No discount for kids and their non-alcoholic cocktail. Ports varied. Joined in Barcelona (busy), then Marseille (appalling port to town connection - used the free bus they try to hide but the service was inadequate to serve a boat the size of Bellissima), Genoa (lovely and quiet on a Sunday), Naples (building site next to port, Pompeii worth the visit), Messina (surprisingly compact and accessible) and Valletta (lovely honey coloured buildings and still a bit English).

However the drinks service was very poor and tables were left uncleared for large periods of time.On this note the pools were of a good size and variety and the water park is a nice feature; although like everything else on the ship it just needs a bit more thought and structure.The Buffet area has way too many small serving areas which causes issues and blockages, on other ships there are more central isle type stations so customers can access from both sides and a natural flow develops.Overall the food was ok but lacked the wow factor of other cruises.The restaurant was similar and it was noticeable as the cruise went on that less people were using it.The shows in the main theatre were very good although no restrictions on people entering at any point which again is annoying.Warning  don't bother paying extra for the Cirque de Soleil as very poor and didn't meet anyone on board who disagreed!Finally the kids club wasn't the best and my daughter who normally spends all her time in these hardly bothered due to lack of activities.Overall the cruise was ok, but just that.

The noise level on the entier ship was awful. And further to this, every afternoon extremely loud singing and dancing started by the pool and on widescreen. Something you might expect for young people at a beach party. This was just terrible. The pools and pool area were definately far to small for the amount of guests. And people reserved sunbeds early in the morning and then left for hours. According to Bellissima rules, this should not be possible, but pool attendant did nothing.Only nice place to be, was at the SPA, where treatments were fantastic.Service charges were 10 euro per day per guest - quite a lot of money, when you consider the number of passengers. However, the SPA staff were not part of this arrangement. Why one of course tipped staff for an excellent treatment. Staff at SPA were very kind and serviceminded.In general staff were unkind. The ship was constantly rocking from side to side.You are also charged 1 euro per day to Unicef - I will decide which charity organization I want to give money - this is not at all up to MSC to deciced for me.We paid 5000 euros per cabin for 7 days, for a disasterous holiday of epic proportions.",Sail Date: August 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Mediterranean|,"Holbaek, Denmark"

We are long time cruisers with Celebrity Concierge Class. We booked a year before the ship went in the water. Unlike other cruise lines, we had no pre cruise communication via email from MSC.  The MSC app only worked half the time. We all booked a balcony stateroom Aurea Class with Premium Plus drink package.  MSC changed the drink package in October, however since we paid the upgrade prior to this date we were to be grandfathered into the maximum drink package available. Which we were not.  MSC miscommunicated this info to our travel agent 6 times.  We found this out during our first dining experience.  Not a great start. Our room was 13119, and although the closet space is very limited, the balcony was huge. Zoe never worked for any of us. There was a smell from the shower drain that at times was unbearable.  Our stateroom attendant was amazing however the smell remained.  Unacceptable for a new ship. There is no account access on the TV, so if you need to confirm on board charges you must stand in line with everyone else at Guest Services, waste of time. The mini bar was convenient and well stocked daily. The walls seemed very thin, I could hear guest next to us often as well as the room above us. Unfortunately I had to complain, it was 3 am. We were never advised that the ship only holds 250EU on your account for on board expenses. This may be due to the card being in Canadian funds, but no explanation was ever given. This amount was spent quickly at the spa, so when it came time to buy a 7.00 gelato we were refused.  Off to Guest Services once again to swipe our card. Food in the dining room was a 2 at best.  We witnessed no dress code being enforced even on Gala Nights.  We saw passengers with jean shorts, t shirts and ball caps allowed in the Lighthouse dining room.  Our table attendants were fantastic, very attentive however the food came out at different times. Not the dining experience you would expect when you read the marketing statements on the MSC web page. We had one specialty dinner at the steakhouse and all but one entrée was perfect.  Really enjoyed the food and service. We ate breakfast and lunch in the dining room, and service was hit or miss.  Food was average.The Spa is beautiful and worth every penny.  The staff were incredible and treatments are priced comparable to most spas at sea.  The main pool...well if you like your deck chair to be packed in like sardines,  a drink at the only pool bar next to the smoking section, enjoy very loud music and pool games, screaming kids in the pool as well as kids running on deck with no adult supervision, and not being allowed to sit on the pool deck with a drink in your hand and feet in the water then this is the cruise for you. Again reading the description of the pool deck for the Bellissima this is not what we expected. The second pool was the same and the aft pool was so small that again the kids took over, while the parents reserved empty pool chairs. Deck 19 reserved for Aurea Class does not have a pool, only a hot tub , no bar, but deck chair bar service.  Anyone can buy day passes. We enjoyed the Champagne bar at night, and the staff were excellent. However they only serve Champagne so if you want a mixed cocktail you need to go to an other bar. We all enjoyed the F1 race car experience, 10.00eu p/p per ride well worth it. We did two tours booked direct with MSC.  Portofino and Capri. Both excellent once you get there.  Took a local ferry back from Capri which was standing room only. Locals had suitcases that took up seats. I believe when you book a tour with the ship then the transfer back to port should be on a boat for that tour only. We had high expectations for MSC.  Yes the ship is beautiful but for the 5000.00usd price tag for 7 days, it did not meet our expectations based on the information provided on the MSC web.",Sail Date: July 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Europe|,"Burlington, Canada"

We had a great time on MSC Bellissima. The ship is just amazing and very glamour. Shame that not all passengers dress up for the special theme evenings. Anyway, we did dress up and we very happy to do so. It is pointless to go on a deluxe cruise ship and dress up as if you are going to Mc Donald. Positive points were: 1. The food is excellent. Fruits & vegetables so fresh. Whether you eat at the ‘canteen’ called the ‘Market Place’ or in your dedicated restaurant, quality is there. My wife is veg. and had no problem to find food she liked. I am intolerant to lactose and wheat. I was able to get non lactose milk and non-wheat bread. So, congratulations to the chef and all the F&B team. 2. The shows in LONDON THEATRE every night are not to be missed. Book and go. They are free and really worth spending 35 minutes every evening. The performers are of international level. Congratulations to all the singers & dancers!3. Service on board was also very good from almost all the staffs, though you could see that some of them were obviously tired late in the evening. I would like to highlight the excellent service from Darwin our waiter in restaurant ‘Le Cerisier’, Sanjit from reception & PR Desk and Muhammad from the Sushi Bar. We prebooked laundry, standard wifi package, drinks and speciality restaurants. This was a very good thing and I would recommend you to do so because you will end up spending much more on board. We also prebooked MSC shore excursions. Though this was a wise decision, especially with the special rate for the 3 tours, however, I strongly advise NOT TO BOOK the family tour in Messina going to Mt Etna which was so disappointed. The description seems very appealing but the guides and supposedly story teller was a joke. No interaction at all with the kids and the tour was a big flop. Basically, the kids get a drawing book, pencils, the guides advise where you should go for a snack, they make a little gimmick at the crater and that’s it! I did voice out my concern to the MSC Excursions Manager Natalia on board after the excursion, but she was useless and we were not refunded which is a shame for a company like MSC because this gives a very bad impression of their level of service and that they do not know what they are selling!A last thing is that you have to be prepared to have lots of crowds all around and I do not advise people to go to the back pool on deck 18 because of the emanation of the dark smoke coming out of the ship’s funnel causing pollution. This is obviously very bad for your health.Globally, I would still give this cruise an 8 out of 10.

Sofa x BED!!!!,"Although  many aspects my cruise was a success I was mislead to the cabin that I selected. I have pictures of the disastrous cabin offered for 2 adults! I wanted a balcony, initially. When booked, 6.5 months prior to departure,  they were all sold out. I settled to an outdoor cabin. No cabin was assigned to me and my friend Alice until 1 week prior to departure. To my surprise it stated that I was placed in a balcony. I was sooooo happy. Could not believe my luck. Only to discover, when the staff took me to the cabin that I was placed on the annex/attachment to a parents' suite. Where kids  stay. NO BEDS. A sofa!!! This was not what I had paid for- My cruise was going to last 15 days. Very uncomfortable to sleep 2 adult people on a sofa bed. Not to mention that once the sofa was open, NO ONE could move in the room. I will be glad to share my photos with you. I attempted to switch cabins. Not once but twice. First, right away, and was told there was nothing available. Then, at the end of the second week, when a lot of passengers departed in Kiel. Well, I took the matter to a second supervisor who promised to fix the issue for us in the second half of the cruise. NOTHING was done. I never signed for a double sofa bed. I requested 2 single beds as I was traveling with a friend. Not even family.  But to be assigned a sofa bed.... instead of 2 beds, this is unacceptable. Really. we bought 6 excursions with this cruise, and paid for the entire 15-day cruise all at once, in advance. How is it possible that we were placed in a room that could not even fit 2 single beds. Once the sofa bed was open, the mini-fridge door did not open. Neither the closet door for our cloths. Really disgusting. Very uncomfortable. I was very dissatisfied with this arrangements. I have traveled in many different cruises in my life, including the old Queen Elizabeth ship,  but less fancy cruises in the US and Europe too, and never ever, had a situation like this. I understand that mistakes are made, but then fix them!!!The staff from MSC Maraviglia cruise did NOT fix our problem. They could have transferred us back to an outdoor cabin which would be preferable because at least we would sleep in beds, not a sofa bed for kids. I am 60 years old and the friend who traveled with me was 53 at the time we travelled. We are not so young any longer... Please give some respect for comfort. Having shared all this, the other aspects of this ship are quite good. Great shows, good cruise activities, excellent paid excursions, great itinerary, pleasant staff on board. I want to believe that what happened to us was an isolated incident that could have been handled a lot more professionally and therfore, I am willing to try travelling with MSC cruise line again.",Sail Date: June 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Friends|Destination: Europe|,

We sailed out of Barcelona on a 7-Day Mediterranean Cruise.  Driving up to the terminal the boat is massive and awe inspiring.   Check-in was the easiest from other cruise lines I've been on.  We encountered our first problem when we tried to eat lunch.  You need to get a beverage package and the one we had was old; at least that what we were told.  The staff could not tell us with any certainty what we were allowed to have.  Even by the end of the cruise, many crew members gave us incorrect information.Our cabin was clean with a balcony and the room was about the average size of a cruise ship.  Something else I had not experienced on other cruise lines was that the food areas (outside and inside buffets) closed early...around 6:00 outside including the pool and the inside dinning area closed around 8:00.  You could not get ice cream on your own and when the food area closed, you could not get ice cream at all.  Although you could get pizza until 1:00 am, some nights that was all you could get.  The food selection was very diverse, but I struggled to find something that I liked. (I admit that this was a me issue not MSC)  You have to push a button on the table request something to drink and many times the servers either walked passed us, took a very long time to bring us our drinks or were confused by what we were entitled to. (example we were entitled to get orange juice; however 5 days into our trip we were told that orange juice was not included)By far the worst part of our trip was the staff.  It wasn't just me, but many people in our group and also by having informal conversation with other travelers also complained about the attitudes of the staff.  I found many staff on the ship to be rude, condescending and unprofessional.  This included the staff that cleaned our room, the dinning hall, buffet area and pool area.  I was very surprised by this being a new ship that the staff were so unaccommodating.  I did find several instances were the staff were very professional and engaging.The ports were great and the excursions were well organized.  I tried to find some redeeming qualities from the MSC Bellissima trip, but it was hard.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  I do a lot of reviews on here and yelp and I try to be objective.  The trip wasn't a total waste and I would try MSC on another trip to see if this is an isolated experience.",Sail Date: July 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Friends|Destination: Mediterranean|,"Hagerstown, Maryland"

Same Supervisor called to let us know our bags finally arrived on our 3rd port stop, we went down to get them and he greated us at the lift to escort us to our bags and had the report/documents ready for us. Breakfast and Lunch at either the buffet or pool deck were great, dinner buffet not so great. Our assigned dinner restaurant was the French Bistro and it was amazing both times we ate there.  We also ate at the Butchers Cut; again amazing and the portions/steaks were huge, our family of 5 could have shared my steak.  The wait staff at both restaurants were very friendly and conversationalist, very welcoming. We tried the Sushi also and being from Hawaii we give it high marks too, great selection and great flavor.Drink packages and Internet packages need work, very costly and very minimal service/choices for high price.The cirque du soleil show was awful, dinner was great.

I had read the bad reviews and was a little anxious.  However!  Everything was bob on and we had a great time!We took private transfers from the airport to port in Barcelona. Checking in was fairly quick and we were on the ship at 1pm.  Rooms were not ready until 2.30pm to we explored and had some drinks at the bar and some lunch in the buffet, which was quite crowded.  We liked the waiter call button on the tables for drinks!We had balcony cabins on the 9th deck, mid ship and near to the lifts.  The cabin was fab, plenty of room, great bed and kept very clean by the steward.  Zoe still does not work!We were allocated a table in the restaurant on 6th Deck and our waiter was Myra.  She was happy and smiling and chatty and could not do enough for us.  The food was amazing – how people can complain I don’t know.  Wine glasses kept full all the time – it did help perhaps that we tipped her 10 euros each night…..We found the buffet to be bedlam all the time with especially the Italians having no concept of queueing, so chose to eat breakfast and lunch in the restaurant on deck 5.  This was a much more civilised affair as you are waited on, recommended!We are early risers so had no problem finding sun loungers.  We did have the big padded ones on a couple of occasions but be aware, the ones at the back of the ship get covered in soot from the funnels and it gets all over you too!  The day at sea was very very crowded as you would expect, but we picked our spot early and we were fine.As we booked last year, we had the drinks package and paid £168 each.  Seems a lot but we more than had our monies worth!  The package included branded spirits, Smirnof and Absolute vodka and Baileys but the Easy package as it now is, doesn’t.  If you like a drink it is well worth it as they add 15% to each drink.We did the cirque de soleil, the cocktail and show package at 15 euros.  The show was fab but the cocktail not so.  You have to add 15% to this so we paid 17.50 euros per person! We also saw a theatre show which the girls enjoyed, the boys not so much.  The interactive boards throughout the ship make it easy to book any shows.It was my birthday whilst we were there, so we booked the Tapas restaurant at an extra charge.  Don’t bother, the food wasn’t all that but the service was good and I got a free bottle of fizz and a birthday cake and the waiters all sung to me.We tried most of the bars.  The English pub serves a selection of English draught beers too.  These were included on our drinks package and better than the Heiniken the boys said.The highlight of our trip was meeting the TV personality and sports pundit Chris Kamara, he was so personable and the boys loved the banter with him.  A lot of the passengers had no clue who he was!We left the ship at all the ports but did our own thing, mostly HOHO buses.  Marsaiile, follow the green line to the free shuttle but into town.  We couldn’t find the petit train to get on but saw it passing by. We got a taxi back at 15 euros as bus queue too long. Genoa – 12 euros city tour bus outside the terminal.  We then walked around the waterfront.  Saw a huge rat here calmly eating in the middle of the path, not scared of humans at all!Naples – we got the HOHO bus.  Don’t bother with the red route, it is far too congested in the town and we hated it.  Traffic terrible.  Noisy dirty place, didn’t like it.  Do the Blue coastal route instead.Messina – HOHO bus again but this is not open top, so disappointing but the route was coastal and scenic .Valetta – turn right out of the port and make for the Barakka lift – 1 euro for return trip – well worth it as it is so steep.  We wandered round and enjoyed the views.Barcelona – we chose to stay over and had a hotel just 10 minutes from La Ramblas.  Again got the HOHO bus – we enjoyed this one the most – 30 euros for day pass,We had the gratuities removed from our bills and tipped as we went along.  Guest services do not bat an eye lid at this.Just one thing, the steward helped herself to juice in our mini bar.  we would not have known only she left the empty.  we confronted her and she replaced it.....otherwise we would of had a charge - its the principal.",Sail Date: June 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Friends|Destination: Mediterranean|,"Preston, Lancs"

We finally emerged with a 7 day cruise of the Western Med on the Bellissima which wasn’t what he had envisaged originally!As the cruise approached trepidation was sitting in but there was no need as this cruise was excellent.Everything from the flight through original embarkation, the cruise itself and then final disembarkation and flights home was really smooth. Our flight arrived in Genoa before 10.00 and we were boarded and sipping our first drink before 11.30! The ship itself was awesome - everything brand new. Our cabin was a balcony cabin on deck 14 and was spacious and had everything required for a week at sea. Only minor grumble was some noise from the Marketplace buffet above but it wasn’t enough to disturb our sleep. Our cabin steward (Paul) was the friendliest guy I’ve met who always had a smile on his face and would do anything for you.The food at both the allocated restaurant and the buffet was excellent and the service could not be faulted. The various stations at the buffet were always topped up with fresh produce regularly. The service, yet again, couldn’t be faulted. The only issue we had was with the Speciality restaurants which we thought were vastly overpriced.There were a number of bars on the ship - at least ten - and even at the busiest times you never waited more than a few minutes to be served. Yet again the staff were always friendly.The entertainment in the regular theatre was very professional and we would highly recommend the Cirque performance - €15 and that included a free cocktail!As I said before there were a number of bars and, if you didn’t want to party all the time on the main concourse there were quieter bars such as the Sky bar and the Edge where you could have a drink.We understood the ship was approximately 80% full (over 4000 passengers) but apart from breakfast and our day at sea the ship never seemed to be crowded.If you’re going ashore to do your own things check out the local shuttle buses from the port - in Barcelona the local shuttle was half the price of the MSC shuttle and took you right to the bottom of Las Ramblas. Two issues for MSC:-1). Sort out Zoe - totally useless and you could do everything on the interactive cabin TV2). Stop the hard sell - especially the photographers who didn’t understand no means no!We would certainly sail on this ship again.Sent from my iPad",Sail Date: May 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Mediterranean|,"East Kilbride, United Kingdom"

W|Jun 2019,/Profile/kylechristopherw,20,"Amazing Company, Average Cruise Line","With the Bellissima being a new ship, it looks like there are lots of varying opinions about the experience on board. I’ll try to include both my positive and negative thoughts, but TLDR: Despite having a blast with our amazing group of friends (nearly 20 in total), I think few of us would consider sailing on MSC for our future cruises.Our cruise was April 12-19. Barcelona > Marseille > Genoa > Naples > Messina > La Valletta > Day at Sea > Barcelona Let’s start with embarkation and disembarkation: because every port is the start or end of someone’s trip (unlike a traditional cruise where all guests follow the same itinerary), getting on and off is pretty quick and seamless. If your ship makes 5 stops while you’re on board, this means that roughly 20% of folks are starting or ending their trip each time. The lines are short and sweet. That being said, this means every stop also includes a safety briefing and somewhat aggressive sales pitches for beverage packages and excursions. Speaking of safety briefings, this process was disorganized and unhelpful. Staff will herd you to a general location, but not give you a clear space to wait and observe. The very minimal information shared (several times in several languages, as MSC does on all announcements) doesn’t help you understand where lifeboats are or what to do in case of an emergency. If you need help understanding how to put on a life jacket in a foreign language however, this event is for you. As you can see all over the internet, the new ship is beautiful, especially the diamond-encrusted stairways and the video-projected marketplace ceiling. But the fact that this is one of the world’s largest ships should not imply that the common spaces are larger-than-life. The extra space on board is used for staterooms and crew. On most cruise ships, you’ll find exterior deck space that is walkable and suitable for lounging with a book, but this is not the case on MSC. Here, plan to find a seat surrounding the pool and other common areas, but be prepared for some crowded seating areas. Lounge chairs are stored before dinner/sunset, so plan your rest accordingly. Some areas are listed as adults only, but there’s no enforcement of this (or seemingly any) policy. While onboard (and in the forums), we heard/read lots of strong opinions about the quality and quantity of food. On every excursion we went on, we would hear cruise guests complaining about this, often comparing the meals to better opinions of other cruise lines. It’s true that MSC restaurant portions are small – perhaps half the size of a typical cruise (and standard American) meal.  I don’t have a strong opinion about this – just something to be prepared for. It’s also true that you’re welcome to order more than one entrée, but be warned that if you order a second during dinner service (as opposed to when you place your first order), you may wait an extended amount of time for your food. The drink selection is decent and plentiful, so if you’re a big drinker, considering a drink package is worthwhile. Because I personally only had 3-4 drinks most days, this wasn't the best deal for me. The easy package does not offer enough options to make it worthwhile, in my opinion, but the package priced right above that was more than enough for most of our group. Also worth noting: although online required the purchase of alcohol drink packages for both my husband and me, once onboard we were allowed to purchase an alcohol package for me and a soda-only package for him. This was a big relief, as my husband does not drink alcohol. Most nights we had really great service in the dining areas, but we were a large party, so understandably a couple of items were occasionally forgotten. The buffet always had plenty of great options for everyone, but seating was sometimes challenging. We splurged one night and ate at Kaito Teppanyaki Restaurant and Sushi Bar and had a great time. Our chef was terrific and outgoing and the food was great. I was the only vegetarian in our large group, and the chef went out of his way to keep my food prepared away from the meats and fish he was cooking. Our drink packages did not apply in this restaurant. For us, our biggest disappointment on this ship was the available entertainment. On the daily itinerary, we struggled to find ANYTHING that seemed both exciting and well planned. We’ve had a blast on other ships watching karaoke, playing trivia and meeting other guests at the planned activities, but this is where MSC was really lacking. They struggled to get guests involved in activities, and what was often planned (polka lessons, for example) didn’t seem to interest more than 5-10 people. Even the worst activities can be made fun with great execution, but this staff and ship were not skilled in this department. The large TV screen above the pool was only ever used for screen saver like images. There was once a Chicago concert event scheduled, but it never played. Literally nothing ever played. The same is to be said of the shows. I’m sure everyone has sat through a bad high school play at some point. Like those, most of the shows on board the Bellissima would take a mother to love. This ship tries –and epically fails- to stage concerts and musicals with a great deal of variety, but all departments (casting, direction, scenery, lighting) just aren’t up to par with even an amateur production you might find in any small city. The dancers are not well trained for the styles of dance they’re put into; singers aren’t often familiar with the English lyrics of the songs they’re singing; LED scenery walls flash at the wrong time, and everything is just really poorly produced. Eden, a musical mashup of The Garden of Eden and The Lion King is especially head-scratching. We attended every show (there wasn’t much else to do at those times), and we probably liked Pink the best (but don’t expect a tribute to pop star Pink: it’s just a female-song-focused revue). The staff talent show, which was made up of waiters, stateroom attendants and front desk staff vs the “professional” entertainers, was a surprising high point in the performance options.  The main highlight of the ship is the Cirque Du Soleil performances. We were a bit frustrated when we realized this was an extra fee on the ship. At the time we booked the cruise, it was not clear to us (or the hundreds of people with similar complaints online) that this was an extra charge, and booking these shows through the app or website was seemingly impossible. The dates online available for us to book weren’t our sailing dates, and three calls to customer service left us no better than the website. Once onboard, we made our first stop to the CDS booking desk, which is tucked away in a small corner. The young man at the desk was clearly overwhelmed because everyone had trouble booking, but he did spend a lot of timing making sure our full party was booked in the right place and at the right time. The theatre only has three rows of seats (on three sides of the stage), so anywhere you sit is great. The drinks provided with your ticket are premade and you select one from the bar as you enter. There are no other drinks available for purchase. Those who purchased the dinner-and-a-show option were seated on either side of the stage behind the drinks-only guests, so if you’re hoping to be close to the action, dinner is not your best bet. We really enjoyed both CDS shows, but for everyone in our party, we better enjoyed Syma over Varélia. Both include lots of fun acrobatics, but Syma had an easy-to-follow story, where Varélia was a bit more abstract and confusing. Both shows are relatively short, but worth the few dollars they cost. The quality of these shows should and could be matched in the MSC-produced shows.Every night in the marketplace was some sort of event (these are likely held by the pool in other weather; our nights weren’t especially warm): a white party, “Flower Glory” night, Romeo and Juliet, etc, but because there’s absolutely no way for guests to know what to pack and plan for (we called a couple times trying to get details), it was often only the staff dressed up. Our balcony stateroom on deck 9 (room 9169) was perfect. The layout of the room was ideal, the closet was a decent fit for the room and the bathroom seemed a tiny bit larger than the other ships we’ve sailed on. Zoe (this ship’s answer to Alexa/Google Home) was absolutely useless. Even our room attendant (who was amazing) wasn’t sure how or why to use the thing. But we had zero issues with anything pertaining to our room. We brought an iron onboard, but otherwise would have had wrinkled clothes (there’s no iron/laundry room).We did not use the spa, although I did get a terrific haircut for about $25. Friends who used the spa enjoyed their experiences, but there are apparently major sound issues because the spa is located above the theatre. If you’re looking for a peaceful appointment, make sure to inquire about conflicting performances and rehearsals. We preferred the excursions we booked off the ship to the ones we bought through MSC. We were majorly disappointed in the Messina city tour, and when we tried to discuss this with the excursion manager, she could not have been more rude and unhelpful. We had other challenges that brought us to the customer service desk almost daily (several wrong charges to our account, for example, or the security guard who had scanned my id card for three days telling me on day four that my picture was unclear and I needed a new one). The staff here was always courteous and did their best to accommodate. There was always a line at the service desk with people having major issues, and rarely did it sound like customers just being too picky.As I mentioned above, we still had a blast with our friends. We had no trouble finding a bar to relax in and we especially made the most of our meal times. My husband and I also bought the digital photo package, which allowed us unlimited digital photos. We went out of our way to stop at every photo backdrop every night, and the photographers were always up for shooting pictures of us. Some of the poses they put us in were silly, but we got tons of laughs out of the cheesy poses and amusing backdrops. They were all incredibly friendly and fun, and we felt this was our best money spent on the ship. (Although, the gelato shop and chocolate shop in the marketplace weren’t too bad either!)For our future cruises, we’ll be seeking better shows, better daily entertainment and better food options, likely for better pricing than what MSC offered. We’ve travelled on Disney Cruise Line, Carnival, and a smaller, private line, and our experience on MSC was the lowest on the list for us.",Sail Date: April 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Friends|Destination: Mediterranean|,

The ship was only launched in March so it is immaculate and ultra modern, now ultra modern is not for every cruiser, the boat also has a lot of people on it so the noise level is high, if your looking for peace and quiet it mightn't be for you. They have a big party every night along the gallery, they really know how to party, again maybe not for you,but certainly the majority of people are having a ball.We purchased are drinks package last year which MSC honoured, the new packages are expensive and don't include ice cream which was disappointing for previous MSC passenger. With these points in mind this ship mightn't be for you but I must say, the food was excellent ,the service by the staff fantastic, and the shows probably the most profession I have see,  no backing tracks here just brilliant musicians, dancers and singers.The ports we stopped at:Naples: a city full of bad tempered drivers avoid it, take a trip to Pompeii instead, you don't have to do the ones on the boat you can prearrange on Internet with some good companiesMarseille , the old port area is worth a visit, the ships shuttle is €16 return , get it, the walk to the free shuttle is long especially in the heat and  unlike the ship shuttle does not run on a regular basis Genoa a lovely city you can walk to it from the ship Messina not the nicest Sicilian town again a short walk from ship but a tour might be a better option. Valletta a lovely city and the highlight of the cruise no need to go beyond it, again walkable from the ship. We didn't do the island tour but people we talked to,, wished they had stayed in Valletta.Barcelona great stop, need to use shuttle from the ship, but I did see people walk into centre, but again in the heat would be tiring.A few years ago we cruised on the MSC Fantasia and this boat and cruise , the Adriatic, suited us better. But there were many happy customers at the end of this cruise, far more positives than negatives. Is it for you ?

Here is a tip for the moaners, say hello, smile, say please and thank you to the staff. It will make you feel better and make their jobs that little bit better.Only 2 small gripes. The ZOE system is rubbish, could not get it to work, but it is not required. Our first cabin on deck 14 was right under the Market Place buffet, which is open  for about 18 hours a day, it was so noisy with footsteps and tables being move we ask to be moved to another cabin. within 25 minutes another  cabin was found on deck 10, equally as good and help was provided to move our luggage.Entertainment was very good. Food in our allocated restaurant ( Lighthouse) was excellent. We ate at the Butcher Cut steak house one night, very reasonable. They provided us with steak knives which was a waste of time as the steak could have been cut with a spoon.Overall, if you have the chance to spoil yourselves, you will not go far wrong with the Bellissima.",Sail Date: May 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Mediterranean|,"Wickford, United Kingdom"

We just returned from a cruise on her, May 20 - 27.  Every aspect of the ship was beautiful.  Our room was an inside cabin and we were surprised at how much room we had, we expected much less.  The food in the dining room was excellent though not much variety and the portions were on the small side, we would usually order 1 more dish to share.  The buffet was as  on most cruise ships though they seem to have more areas closed when they should have been open.  The service onboard, especially at the bars was unusual, but the norm for MSC as we have found from several cruises with them.  This ship being currently Med based, we did have a few language barriers, but understandable due to location.  We never had any issues getting off.  The only real issues we had were with our cabin.  After several reports on the AC not being controllable they did nothing, the frig did not work at first and after 3 days they got it working.  Laundry service was probably the best we've had on a cruise, clothes came back nice, flat, and folded, not looking like they wadded them up first.  The shows onboard were odd, some made you wonder about what Europe calls entertainment.  Of the 2 Cirque shows, 1 was very good the other just ok.

We missed out Marseille due to inclement weather.The ship is simply stunning , normally I would say lots to do but the issue here is money.MSc simply charge for everything. Having paid a tidy sum for our room there was no welcome basket or drink. All I could see was a list of prices.There were lots of lounges where on could sit to relax, except you could not relax as every 20 mins you had to negotiate another waiter who in one hand had his credit card skimmer. And we politely refused his offer. If you call it a relaxing cruise then think again.The best part of the cruise was when we were in port and off the boat paying local prices.Food : no complaints as there was always lots of options. We missed our table sitting so often down to dinner time so we went to self service in the market place or as we named it Mess hall. Passengers were very rowdy especially the Italians who scream and shout.There was one day when hundreds of students came on board in Genoa ,all they cared about was getting their value for money , there was no where to sit and when one found a seat you ended up next to some screaming Italian studentsAnd so it goes on.Room was very acceptable our maid was super and always very helpful.We cancelled our on board tip (what it's for I really don't know) and gave a private tip to our maid.We will not be going on MSc again our preference will be Princess cruises in the Caribbean area especially with no screaming passengers",Sail Date: May 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Mediterranean|,glasgow

This was the first and will be the last with MSC cruise line. We are a mix bag of families and friends from Hong Kong and USA, age 20 to about 75. Love travel, love cruising. Enjoy good food and have good amount of experience with other cruise lines. There are many reasons we do not like this cruise line (see below). We bought the 'Fantastica experience' because the luxury 'yacht club' cabins were sold out. There are so many levels of 'experience'. We choose the middle one. That became the major reason we will not choose this cruise line again:Detail: One of the cabin ran out of facial tissue. Asked the steward and he said only one box of facial tissue was allowed for the whole 7 days trip. There was no wash cloth provided neither. How can we clean and dry our face? Toilet paper?Asked customer service, who asked us back: 'Are you in yacht club cabin?' 'No.' 'Then for environmental reason, we only offer one box of facial tissue for your cabin.'WHAT???? That means the yacht club (people who paid more) did not have to care about the environment and can have more than one box of facial tissue? Is it hypocrite or discrimination?  Or both?The rest of the bad experience were:- Pre-trip, we tried to buy restaurant package online, which offered to choose the date and time of dining. We did, but the system gave us different date and time after check out. We wanted to eat together. Called but no help because we bought the cruise via third party. We cancel the purchase and bought again, and again, and again. No luck. Never gave us the date and time we wanted. No help even after many calls. Different agents gave us different answers. Some even lied. At the end we had to rush to check in early onto the ship in order to rush to the restaurants to make sure we got the same date and time. So much anxiety! Really unhappy even before the cruise. - bought premium drink package. Did not worth it. Individual drinks (both alcohol and non alcohol) were reasonable price onboard anyway. If you will be out everyday day for excursion like us, you would not drink that much. Besides, you have to buy the same package for all people in the same cabin even only one person drink. We lost big money out of this policy.- Quality of drink (even the same drink) were different from bar to bar. Some were really awful. Coffee was all bad. Premium coffee even worse.- bought  4 restaurants package. The package menu choices in all 4 restaurants were very limited. (You would not know it until you sit down at the restaurants.) All the really good food were not in the package menu in all 4 restaurants. So we choose to pay more on top of the (already paid) package each time. Still very disappointed with the quality and taste of food. We rated them from B- to C. So disappointed! - The virtual reality race car was terribly designed. You must be physically fit to get in and out of the car. The experience was not 'real' at all anyway. Waste of money. (The rest of the games at the game room are good though, if you are willing to pay the US $12 to US$18 per game plus 15% service charge.)- The free rope walking activity (the one that surround the water park) was fun for some people but not enough warning: there was no 'going back', nor option to come down if you feel incapable after entering. Some of us did that. Some had fun, some was horrified. But it did not looked scary until you got up, when there was no coming down. You had to finish the whole course once you were up. This activity was poorly designed. - Dining room designed was the worst we ever seen, in compare with other cruise line. No grand decoration, no character. Unpleasant. - Cabin theme color was dark and depressing. Color of carpet was horrible and cheap, did not match anything in the room. And makes the small cabin look even smaller. The only good thing about the cabin was the smart utilize of tiny space.- No game room, which was our usual gathering and social place at all our many previous cruising. No. Not in MSC. - Zoe was useless, as noted by many travelers. - Many billing mistakes. Meaning many trips to customer service. Well, we had time to spare, not much to do on the ship anyway. We advice you to watch your bill closely by using the MSC app.The good:- Crews overall were polite and helpful. Some stewards even noted our needs (Jars of hot water, wash cloth etc.) And had them ready in the cabin everyday. - Beautiful LCD dome.- Chocolate shop sold good quality chocolate. (not include in cruise package)- Shows every night were good quality (except the magic show.) We can use the MSC apps to reserve, which was great. They were not Broadway shows but very well done. - Food at complimentary buffet and dining room are overall B+ to A. Hit and miss, which is common in many mid-price cruise.  We regret we bought the 4 restaurants package. We should have op to go to dining room and buffet instead. - Check in and check out were smooth, despite the rain.- Live music all day. Like them all. It made the run to customer service a little more bearable.  Neutral:- The two Cirque de Soleil shows were $18 each with drink. Yes we watched both. (There was not much to do since we did not dance nor sing) Short and sweet. The same company at Macau and Las Vegas use real water (characters jump in and out of water) and in much larger scale. For people who have already watch them in Macau and Las Vegas, disappointed. But for people who never have the experience, it is good chance to get a taste of it, and with a very good price. Just one thing: there was a night that they only served grapefruit juice as non-alcoholic drink. Big risk. Grapefruit interact with many medications which double or triple the medication effectiveness. In short it causes overdose. Please serve other juice instead.- gym is smaller than average. OK for short cruise.At the end, MSC lost 13 future customers (and their friends) by refusing to offer one more box of facial tissue.",Sail Date: May 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Family (multi-generational)|Destination: Mediterranean|,"Princeton, New Jersey"

We boarded in Barcelona, no queuing. You can public transport it all the way and back from around €10/ for two people. or a taxi for €35 each way by the way.There are great shows in the London Theatre that you only seem to find out about once your on board. We went to the Magic Show, Pink and Solid Rock all very slick. We did the late shows after dinner around 22:45. Be aware there may be crying babies in the audience. One of the things about this cruise is that you can't compare it to RCI, for example, It's very European with a younger cooler crowd and a few young families on board. Cirque du Soleil gets plenty of pre-boarding promotion and it's a great show by the way! On board Show and Cocktail €15. Show and three-course dinner €35.Bedroom has a great bed and ample space, absolutely spotless. Good selection of European TV channels but on News in English (if you're into telly on a cruise that is!)Complimentary restaurant had a daily changing menu and we were sometimes spoiled for choice. the quality was excellent. There are four complimentary restaurants for dinner, you can have breakfast and lunch there too if you don't fancy the Market Place Buffet. If you've cruised before you'll know that the buffet is like... a bit of a free for all where you just pile it on your plate. The buffet had a daily changing Ethnic Corner ( a great Lamb Madras!) Wellness area, Veggie stuff, Pasta and in general the quality was quite high - but see below. In your Complimentary restaurant expect waiter service. They bring your fry-up to you table with as much freshly pressed juice and quality coffee. The menu include Kippers, Eggs Benedict and a few other things. The Complimentary Restaurant menus are all the same. The only difference is the Lighthouse restaurant has a wall of windows overlooking the rear of the ship As for the Spa... you must do the massage for around 88 euro as an absolute minimum.We visited the Teppanyaki, I had the Emperor menu for €59 plus service, was quite a lot of food and an hilarious show! I don't know if it's like that every night but the guests were wild and crazy - lots of singing, congas etc. Probably one the best nights ever! Also did the Holas Tapas. Did the free flowing Tapas (seems to only be available on board) €23 - which included all you can drink Sangria. Was a good price but be careful when he asks ""would you like anything more?"" this bumped my bill from €23 to €42 (well Oysters aren't cheap lol!)I didn't take a drinks package as I tend to try to ""get my money's worth"" and end up slaughtered but you can get reasonably drunk for around 300/week on board. Remember you might doing a bit of drinking in Malta, Marseilles etc. as well. We hit the Masters of the Seas with Heineken at €6 pint, John Smiths at €6.50 and Guinness at €7. The rest of the ship only has Heineken mostly. When doing the numbers for drinks package bear in mind the prices I give you will have 13% added. In the drinks package this is already includedNot So GreatI usually have my room made up two or three times a week as I tend to pre-tidy up before the room lady arrives. Left the Do Not Disturb light on and the Make My Room light off but she came in at least 4 times and changed towels unnecessarily, moved all my stuff around etc.The crew, unusually, seem to be able to access all the passenger bars/restaurants and are often seen in uniform having drinks and food. Expect to wait till the waitress has finished chatting with them before you get served. Because of this - for the first time ever - I declined to pay the Staff Gratuities at the end of my cruise (I did, however, pay it back in tips to the people who made a difference for us)The lifeboat drill is a total farce. There were passengers milling about not involved so you couldn't see what was going on. Attendance wasn't controlledI considered a drinks package because of the draft guinness etc. in the Masters of the Sea but unfortunately it was the worst ever. You won't see many people drinking it. The Masters doesn't seem to have enough glasses so expect your Belgian fancy beer to be served in a Hefe glass, for exampleThe toaster bread in the Market Place was quite stale (hard) at 11:00.All in All the staff are wonderful and seem to be coping with a lack of support from management. Like I said, it's more ""European"" I did a similar itinerary with RCI (Harmony) which was bit more ""professional"" but maybe not as much fun at the same time.That being said I personally will be trying Celebrity for my next cruise...",Sail Date: May 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: Friends|Destination: Mediterranean|,Darmstadt

This was our first time with MSC and it is certainly going to be our last. We boarded very easy at Southampton, we expected at least a welcome drink as we boarded, due to it been it's first trip, we would be so lucky. Instead we we pestered by the staff to purchase drinks packages and photos. The Ship looked stunning when you boarded and the Galleria walkway was beautiful. After boarding at 11am we had a good look around until 2pm when it was announced our cabin was ready. We found our way to the cabin quite easily, however we were disappointed when we arrived. We booked a Fantastica balcony cabin, the cabin very very narrow, there was not enough wardrobe hanging space, certainly not if you were travelling for two weeks. The bathroom was small but adequate, although you had to open the shower door to bend down to wash your feet. Zoe the virtual assistant was useless so we gave up trying to use it. The food was ok but small portions in the main restaurant, I have since found out you could order as many portions as you wanted, don't think I would have been happy to do that though without loooking gready. The Buffett restaurant was always very busy and the food was nothing to shout about in there either. The entertainment was very poor, the Theatre shows only lasted 35 minutes, you just sat down and it was time to leave. The small Bellissima Lounge was used for dance classes and exercise classes, it was far too small to be used as the main area of entertainment. The Champagne Bar and Cocktail Bar only had a few seats so you were very lucky to find one. We found the service in the Bars very poor, although this did seem to improve on the last couple of days. The Library was a joke it was in the Champagne Bar and consisted of one shelf of books. The organisation on the Ship was very poor, especially the Muster Station drill, what a waste of time that was. The weather conditions was very bad around the Bay of Biscay and we were informed that we were not going to stop at our first Port of call. No additional entertainment was put on and we were so bored, there was nothing much to do unless you spent extra to use the facilities, like ten pin bowing etc. The Ship rolled that much glasses and bottles were falling of the shelves, one poor lady fell of her stool and banged her head, it was very difficult to walk around the Ship and when we laid on our sides in bed we rocked that much we thought we were going to fall out of the bed. The Captain, if there was was, never used the PA system once to speak to his passengers not once throughout the 8 nights onboard. The only reason we enjoyed ourselves was because of the lovely people we met onboard. MSC was more interested in trying to make money off the Passengers once on board than trying to make their journey a one to remember, although we will remember this Cruise but for all the wrong reasons.",Sail Date: March 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Europe|,"Durham, United Kingdom"

There were many bad experiences but let me start, the first day we get dressed went to our assigned table, they do not offer any time seating and you do not choose the time to have dinner. We sat down and the waiter ask what we were dinking we both said water, they ask us for our ship card to charges us for water I explain I just wanted tap water. They said they DO NOT PROVIDE TAP water and if we wanted water we would have to buy a none alcoholic package, the package would cost me for me and my wife 40 dollars a day for 7 days, yes $280.00 for tape water.We argue with the waiter and decide not to drink water so we ask for tea, to came with two cups of hot water no tea bag ever came.  The next day we went to the front desk to report the incident, the person at the first spoke Portuguese but what she did not know was that we were multilingual also. We explained that when we booked the cruise  the package included  beverages,  she researched and explain that the European cruise we had to pay for all beverages. While she is on the phone she made reference to  the other end of the conversation that we were  Americans as though we were spoiled people now my wife and  I were furious.  Entertainment included one show per evening and that was it.  They had a dance hall with people dress up in different themes and as you walk by they would pull you to dance. It reminded me once one of those sleazy bars I experience while in the military. The food was terrible the portion were small, and not well presented or cooked. I ask for ravioli they brought over three ravioli. One evening due to our mistake in time zone change to get to the dinner late, they did not allow us to sit and directed us to eat some place else. The ship is like a cab at every port people were getting on and off that was very strange. We were so discourage, we have been on over 50 cruises and never had this type of experience.  I could continue but let this be your warning stay away from MSC  even the employees warned us.  We were board to death we could not wait to get off the ship.",Sail Date: March 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Europe|,

Some improvemnets have been made to the inside family cabins, no shower curtains anymore, much improved shower cubicles, 2 single wardrobes better positioned made it feel bigger for a family of 4.  The beds were very comfortable and the cabin staff very efficient, Can a cruise ship be too big? maybe, it does offer alot such as water slides, which were good fun, but it does put pressure on the staff i.e 3 sittings at dinner, which is alot of people to serve.  Getting on and off at the ports however was quite quick and security was a priorty. The food is very good, and plentiful although the main restuarants have cut down to 3 courses which previously was 5 or 6 courses if wanted, but you certainly will not go hungry!  If you do not have a drinks package drinks are quite pricey with a 15% service charge added to all drinks.  It is a shame that the extra activities are so expensive now, with bowling at 30 euro's for 30 mins it made it unaffordable.  If you want to make sure you get in to the show you needed to book in advance normally for the first and second shows of the eve, the last show at 10.45pm was not so popular so you could get in without booking, booking is easy either in your cabin or on screen aound the ship, as we were in group it was handy to be able to use the phones around the ship to call other cabins.  If you have a easy drinks package, not all the bars serve all the drinks, beware that only certain drinks are included so if you ask for a certain brand of drink and it is not included you will be charged, we were on one occasion but were not asked to sign for this so were not aware until the bill came at the end of the cruise, which did not seem right.  The ship is beautiful and most of the staff great, in particular the restaurant staff and the cabin staff. The food is very good, the bread, cakes pasta and ice cream really good and you feel the staff are very proud of the ship and the company, i would recommend MSC",Sail Date: April 2019|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: Family (multi-generational)|Destination: Mediterranean|,woking

Packing pods are too big for the drawers & shelves.  Drawers & shelves are “way too small”.   Not well designed.  Bedside shelves are way too small.*Wardrobe doors don’t open & close easily.*No “carry-own bags off”!*Activation of credit card is a HUGE  hassle.  Account should be linked “online” prior to sailing like Royal Caribbean & Princess*Too much smoking! Everything smells of smoke.  IT STINKS!  Everywhere stinks of smoke - around time he pools where kids are, in the casino, other areas. *Waited 40 minutes for icecream upstairs - only one person serving.  The staff are “lovely” ... there’s just not enough of them!!*Long waits for everything - 30-40 minute wait for drinks.  **Insufficient staff to passenger ratios - very insufficient.  What staff there are, are lovely!*NO “adults only pool area” - BIG disadvantage!*MSC online is very hard to get around.  Booked restaurants and Cirque de Soleil online only to find when boarding there was no such booking.  And everything on the MSC was hard to do!!  Unlike Royal Caribbean and Princess who’s sites are EASY in comparison1*Embarkation was easy - no hassle at all as people get on and off at every port.  Embarking is hassle-free.*Ship is lovely and new and clean, albeit with a few operational kinks!!*Simon in the Lighthouse Dining room is AWESOME.*Paid for 2 Plus 1.  Went to the steak house. They had run out of NY steak. Only had one type of steak to choose!!  An 8 oz as opposed to a 16 oz.*Speciality Restaurants should be the entire menu (like Royal Caribbean & Princess) not just some options.",Sail Date: April 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Friends|Destination: Mediterranean|,

The staff in the yacht club were amazing and the rooms were beautiful.  But...this is where the positives end.  The food was very average in the Yacht Club dining room.  I'm not a fine dining connoisseur but it left a lot to be desired.  I've been on several cruises and understand that portions are a little on the smaller side.  However, these were the smallest portions I have ever seen!  I ordered the lasagne one night and ended up getting one noodle curled on itself and sauce in the middle. We dined in the MSC yacht club for several nights and decided to get room service instead or just went to the buffet.  The Yacht Club buffet on the upper deck was good but they closed the top deck down so early and so often that we could barely use it.  I couldn't believe that everything closed down SO early.  Both the regular pools and MSC Yacht Club pools closed down at 7pm!  Yep...7pm.  That includes the jacuzzis as well.  I've been on other ships where you could use the jacuzzis to the wee hours of the evening.  They also had ping pong and foosball by the pools but they also close down at 7pm!  So...the only activities left are ones that you have to pay for.  You want to go to the evening show...then you're going to have to buy tickets.  You want to bowl?  That's 30 Euros for 30 minutes.  The formula One cars and everything else nickle and dimed so much that it was infuriating.  Granted...I understand that for video games and such they want to charge but there was hardly anything included At ALL!We recently went on a Norwegian Cruise in August of 2018.  The shows were free, the pools/jacuzzis were open late, they had trivia and games going on all the time for free.  The only day that MSC had any trivia and games was on the last day at sea.  We didn't even bother because we figured that would cost money too.Overall, I would not recommend MSC as a cruise line.  The Bellisima may have been a beautiful ship with a lot of amenities but get ready to be nickle and dimed to death!  So many other cruise lines to choose from!",Sail Date: April 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Mediterranean|,"Salt Lake City, Utah"
