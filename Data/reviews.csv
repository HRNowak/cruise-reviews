You would think this to be a value experience but by the time we added it all up, the cost came to over $14000. If we had used an all inclusive cruise line, it might have been similar. This ship was supposed to have been renovated in 2019, but wear and tear already shows less than a year later. The itinerary is always the beckoning call with Princess. They do have that going for them. But in this time of crisis (the virus) with two of their ships in trouble I was amazed that they did little for this ship. Never a mention or temperature taking while people coughed and hacked and wore masks.Anyway, that will be our last Princess cruise.",Sail Date: February 2020|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: South America|,

Large TV that got major American news stations and provided updates on all tours with lectures.  Entertainment included classical violin, piano, nightly extraordinary name performances in the theater, art lectures and auctions, many dining areas and bars with entertainment, elegant lobby - in fact, for us, a deligtful experience all around.

Captain Todd McBain and his staff were great and for the most part, it was a smooth sailing through wind storms and high waves.  we missed Montevideo, our first stop after BA, due to high winds.  Falklands were mainly a stop to see birds and penguins.  the sailing around the cape and scenic cruising in and out of the various islands of the Antarctica peninsula were scenic and Princess had 3 naturalist lecturers on board.  scenery became a bit repetitious of glacier after glacier but we were fortunate to have 2 good sunny days to view the icy landscape practically devoid of whales, seals and penguins.we enjoyed naturalist Mark Harris the most and attended all his lectures about marine mammals, etc.  ""Alaska on steroids"" was his most common phrase to describe Antarctica.  Mark has a very positive view of life and we appreciated his humor and lively delivery of the various subjects such as sharks, turtles and penguins. we saw many glaciers and some impressive sized icebergs but no glaciers calving like in Alaska.  we felt that the remoteness of Antarctica is not really worth the money and flight time of 14 plus hours. unless one must see Antarctica, not having a chance to land on the continent is a quasi claim that we visited this continent.we had problems with our balcony room from day one with wind noises and air coming through the sliding balcony door.  the wind was forcing air through the fixed door and the sliding door.  we told our room steward and we did not get any response for over a day.  we called the front desk personally and at the end of the 2nd day and they finally sent maintenance staff to look at the problem.  he noted the problem and said that he has to return later.  he also noted that our room was cold.  we had set the thermostat to the highest setting but no heat came out.  maintenance told us to call front desk and ask also for HVAC repair.  now we have 2 issues of cold air coming in and no heat.maintenance came in the afternoon of the 3rd day and put weather seal around the top the door and about 3 inches down the side where the wind came in.  we experienced more wind storms on our way to the Falklands and the wind noise and air came in again but now lower than the previous location.  we asked for a maintenance manager to inspect the problem and he acted like this was a rare occurrence.  when the actual repair person came, he added 4 more inches of weather seal between the fixed and sliding doors.  this finally fixed the wind noise and air intrusion.  when we asked him about this type of repair, he said that he has to service 7 sliding doors that day the same way.  we were really disappointed on Princess' maintenance when the sliding doors for all balcony rooms would have this type of problem sooner or later.we normally enjoy eating in the main dining room for dinner, but Coral Princess's main dining food and menu were uninspired and we found eating in the buffet more enjoyable.  we did have one special dinner for new years' eve where they served 2 tasty lobster tails.  the afternoon tea between 3-4 is still very good and had excellent scones served with jam and cream.  one of the staff held 2 lessons in Spanish and we wished there were more.Princess stage performances were good and we had to arrive 30 minutes early just to get seats in a packed theater for the early performances.  the gym was equipped adequately and we used it 12 times over 16 days since there were only 4 ports for a 16-days cruise.  although it was start of summer down south, Antarctica was about 32-35 degrees Fahrenheit.  we had warmer temperatures in Chile.  embarking and disembarking were well done along with efficient tendering.Coral Princess and this particular cruise itinerary is at most a 3-1/2 stars.  interesting but not too satisfying for excitement, novelty and quality of food.",Sail Date: January 2020|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Antarctica|,

We were extremely impressed with Princess's organisation for boarding and disembarkation also with the cleanliness and hand washing regime. The excellent knowledge of the three expert lecturers on board and the sheer enthusiasm of Capt Todd McBain taking us to unchartered waters, whales and wildlife made the whole Antarctic experience for us.  We also enjoyed the gym, the library (both of which probably kept me sane during the long boring bits of sailing) and being able to book a table for dinner at a time to suit us. The food was ok, we weren't expecting fine dining. So glad we booked a balcony cabin, which was very comfortable and spacious on the starboard side so we had fantastic views and we were so lucky with the weather that we had four full scenic cruising days. Lots of cheesy entertainment and extras we weren't interested in and designed to relieve you of your money; casino, art auction, diamonds, shopping etc., so just avoided them. We enjoyed our experience overall and it was a great way to achieve our desire to see Antarctica but personally don't get the whole cruising thing.

Very special. the ship was renovated with all new carpets but still showed her age..the food was plentiful (it was a cruise..) but not special. The entertainment had some good nights and some bad. there was a piano player in the Crooner's lounge who was great. He sang all the great songs and told wonderful insider stories.

Found this ship a little smaller than the others, and miss having a pool by the Sanctuary. But very quickly we got used to it. Been smaller we got to meet very nice people from many different countries that we keep in contact with. Martinique and St.kits we already been there before. Just had to book diferente places this time and was great. Cockleshell Beach in St.Kitts is beautiful and the scenic drive was very impressive. Martinique I advise everyone to book the Botanical gardens. Great long suspension bridges, so much nature arroud. Great place to visit. Days a sea we always enjoy. So much to keep you busy, or just relaxing. I enjoyed the Zumba classes fallow by some country dancing. Unfortunately our instructor had an injury not related with the class (Zumba)on the second day. After that we had a diferente class with Maria (Jr.Ass.Cruise Director).She was a little overwhelmed on the first few days. But to me she was perfect after that. I can only praise that girl for taking charge over something she never had done before. The class right after was also lots of fun.This class was giving by some of the cast dancers. Matias and Aurelia made sure to keep all off us going. After all we had already had an amazing workouts with Maria just before. Salvador, Brazil started on of the reasons for the choice on this cruise. Sao Francisco church and Cathedral is something to see. We loved to walk on the streets and experience some of the delicious juices and dancing Samba with the locals.We had a good time. First day in Rio the Janeiro, Brazil was the best!!Very well organized trip also booked with the cruise line. Never had to stand in lines. First we went to Sugarloaf and we are glad that it was planned in that order. We loved the views. From there our guide made sure to confirm that everything was ready for us in the restaurant.At Fogo the Chao the service couldn't be any better and the food delicious. Great choice!!Continue to get better and better. Christ the Redeemer.We travel lots and we have seen wonderful places. But nothing like this. It was breathtaking!!Lots of respect for everyone involved in getting such an opponent structure up there. And the views we all could stay there hours and hours just mesmerized!!The second day I got a guide recommended by a friend that was amazing.Is name is Flavio Amit.We got to go to the biggest Favelas  that they have by the name ""Rocinha"".We felt very safe. I got my cell ready for pictures all the time.Obviously we had no diamonds or anything to provoke attention. But that is common sense everywhere in the World. Also went to the soccer field Maracana.One of the ""most important ""places for my husband that loves soccer. After nothing better than to go to Copacabana and Epanema beach. It was a great feeling swimming there. In the cruise the food was always great. We didn't have a set time. But just after two days,we got to meet such a  wonderful group of people.From then on we all reserved the same table until the end of the cruise. Our water Agnelo was so meticulous to make sure he got to know the special preferences of everyone in our table.Great knowledge in wines that was appreciated by my husband. Always surprising us with diferente treats and before we had to ask our special tea and coffee was at the  table to wend the dining.Also the junior waiter Manuel couldn't give us a better service. Our mini suite was spotless. Lots of attention to detail by our great stateroom steward Franco!!About the show's it was a little less than expected in some days. But can't stop praising the cruise cast (dancers and singers).We loved every show they performed. Can't forget to give credit to the cruise Director Fernando. I'm sure he managed to do everything in is power to make sure our entertainment was pleasant. Uruguay it was very nice. Love to go there one day and stay for a few days. A very calm place to enjoy holidays. I'm sure there is so many people making sure our cruises go nice and smooth. But I can only talk about the one's I had contact with. Helen from China (Housekeeper attendant).She was always keeping the bathroom's by the buffet sparkle. And made sure to go the extra mile to open the door for me. Mary Joy,from Philippines (ass buffet steward)and Kape from India (ass Bar steward).They have a smile that we could recognize from the distance. Interesting that you have time to pay attention to a lot if you are in holidays and relax. We notice a person that was making sure every show by the pool was without any problems. We could see all is constant attention that I got up to praise him. Is name is Serhiy from Portugal (Audio 1).A the reception every single person was pleasant. But most of the time my great ""helper"" was Igor from Serbia (service Agent).The person that I was very surprised that was not friendly was the Captain's Circle Host!!Not a smile out of that lady!!I was very surprised and sad to see. In that position I always expected a very pleasant person. Also booked with the cruise we got out in Buenos Aires and got transferred to Sofitel.It is great to put your suitcases at the door of your room in the ship and only see them again in your room at the hotel. We enjoyed two days in Buenos Aires before caming back home 🇨🇦.Every holiday is diferente.Is going to be things you like more in one place than other.Overall it was perfect. We had a great time and we never know in the future if back in the same ship. All depends on the route and pricing of our like 😊Overall it was perfect.

We were evacuated to the Lodge parking lot with the clothes on our back and waited for 3 hrs.in the sun before being transferred by bus to another location to wait for further direction.

All of our excursions were simply wonderful, informative and interesting. The only down side of this portion of the trip, particularly in Fairbanks, was feeling somewhat captive to the lodge offerings relative to meals and meal choices. True, you could opt to go into town in Fairbanks or walk across the highway in Denali, but that was not always a desirable choice when exhausted from travel or having been out all day on excursion. It wasn't the worst, but we found choices limited and relatively pricey during this part of the trip. Maybe it was just us. Princess seamlessly handled every aspect of our tour. The train from Denali to Whittier was clean, comfortable and the domed cars offered amazing views. On the train near Anchorage, we were checked in for the cruise so when we arrived at the ship, we were given our sail cards and ready to go. It was refreshing to enter our cabin and find our luggage already waiting for us. The cruise on Coral Princess was very nice in every way. If you are looking for super high end, however, it was not. It was great for our purposes of exploring Alaska though. I am a big iced tea drinker, and their iced tea was far superior to other cruise lines I have been on. I realize that is not an important factor for many people, but it was for me. Our service from top to bottom was very good, and I would definitely recommend this Cruise Tour.

There was not an excursion we did not like.The Denali lodge room was very small, but mostly clean and adequate.  The McKinley lodge was larger, very clean and nice but both lodges/rooms need updating…they are rather dated.The food in the lodges was very good (we got vouchers, great way to go), with the exception on 20,320 in McKinley property- poor service and poor food. Otherwise, we’d give the lodge food two thumbs up, especially for the lodges being out in the hinterlands.The food on the ship was overall mediocre, with some good meals and a couple bad meals (the king crab legs and their salmon were not good or well done).  The buffet is ARAmark-worthy (mediocre institutional all you can eat…meh).  We chose anytime dining in Bordeaux dining room and it was up and down food quality…choose the waiter’s recommendation.Seemed most of the food-particularly the meat and cooked veggies had been frozen, not fresh.The speciality restaurant we went to, Bayou Cafe was rather ordinary and being familiar with Cajun/Creole, the food did not resemble food from that region, although it was OK, not great.The service from start to finish was very good at the lodges, everyone was unfailingly helpful (other than 20,320) and on the ship for the most part good.  We had a super room steward - Teodoro Garcia -deserves recognition as does Rafael in the Bordeaux dining room.  On the ship we encountered language problems with some of the staff (particularly at the front desk!) not speaking or comprehending English very well.  Senka Jahic was particularly unhelpful and sarcastic.  Our ship room had a balcony and was generally nice.  Made for some great views of the glaciers.  The bathroom (our room was B-339) had a stench that we realized was sewer-like coming from the shower stall that was so small you couldn’t bend over.  We did our best to deal with it, closing the door to the bathroom.  The room had plenty of storage space, which was nice, at the sacrifice of the shower stall.Overall, we liked the tour, enjoyed seeing everything about Alaska we saw…book as many excursions as you can handle.  Giving this overall three stars because of the cruise ship room and the food issues.Also, the Coral Princess is rather dated and needs a remodeling…and the bathrooms. If you go on the cruise ship and are a foodie, lower your expectations and focus on enjoying Alaska. If we had to do it again, we’d probably choose a smaller ship (2,000 or so on this ship) and pay a little more for better food.  Three star overall out of five, but we VERY MUCH LOVED seeing Alaska and did not let the shortfalls disappoint the experience for us.

Voyage of the glaciers southbound!,"We chose the Coral Princess because of its small size and the itinerary it provides for viewing both Hubbard Glacier and glacier bay! Southbound especially. Those coming North had less glacier time and didn’t have energy left to deal with daily transfers. The smaller boats do get very close to Hubbard glacier and that was by far the best part of the journey.The small boat also handled its crowd well. There are much bigger ships but we heard complaints from those on the bigger boats with long lines for dinners (even with fixed dining schedules) , crowds in port, etc.Highest marks to princess on their Logistics. They were spot on and organized to the T! Every transfer was so well done throughout the land and ocean voyage excursions. Boarding and off boarding were efficient and usually right on schedule and often ahead of schedule.Lowest marks were on the Fairbanks princess lodge. It needs some serious updating.Lesson learned-you should opt for multiple nights in Denali at each hotel and not the single night transfers. You need full days to fit in the longer excursions or you won’t see the mountain (due to clouds) or you won’t see the animals (that are mostly further into the park). The standard package doesn’t give you enough time.Food in general was very good but repetitive. Salads were either not available or flavorless and watery. But Meat dishes and seafood were plentiful and excellent. Only disappointment was the lobster imported from Brazil. Otherwise ate every seafood option available and loved it all. Pizza and basics were plentiful during the day but at night this boat shuts down and goes to sleep (by 10:30pm). This is not a party boat and had little for the kids to do. It was mostly elderly with a fair mix of mid 40’s to 60’s there for fishing , wildlife and glacier excursions.There was plenty of live music throughout the cruise in the bars and atrium and it was good quality. The whale watching was spectacular throughout.A plus - the boat is well lit at night.A con - the boat is well lit at night.No nighttime stargazing to view the Milky Way or Aurora , lights stay on at all levels all night on all decks and in every spot of the ship.We saw a few game shows that were funny and Voice of the Ocean was great. We couldn’t attend many other shows due to our excursions.Suggest you do the any time dining as fixed dining proved to be a challenge for us.If your goal is to get the most out of Alaska and not what I hear a traditional cruise provides for partying, shows and drinking - I highly recommend the Voyage of the Glaciers Southbound.This was our first cruise and a very different style of vacationing than we are used to- but we absolutely loved it.",Sail Date: August 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Alaska|,

However, I have a real problem with the condition of the ship as well as their policy regarding  price matching for excursions.  I believe it to be deceptive advertising and feel as if our family of five had been ""taken.""  When I was planning excursions I saw that they have a ""Best Price Guarantee"" policy for excursions.  In order to take advantage of this ""Best Price"" we had to pay up front then submit the request form stating the name of the company that offered a lower price for the excursion, which I did.  Long story short, We contacted TWO Guest Services desks while on the cruise then were told they never received the faxed request (for which we have the OKd Fax Transaction print out).   Then they said we had to call Princess once we got home.   We did that and have been given the run around three days in a row.  Also, Princess has started ""nickel and diming"" the guests, having us pay for bottles of water, drinks at mealtime, etc.  This is my second Princess Cruise (the first one was great).   It is also my last.   So - let the buyer beware and don't book with Princess.

We had an outside cabin on the port side (goood choice) so had great views of the land and glaciers.  The crew throughout the ship were top notch—fast and friendly.  The shows we took in were Vegas style and quality. The food was great with numerous options.  The only downside was that we were continually “lost”!  That was more due to us being ‘navigationally challenged’ than due to the ship and just provided some additional laughs and adventures.

This review is about the ship, not the overall cruise/experience.We had a beautiful room with a balcony and comfortable beds. The bathroom was small, as expected with a cruise ship, and it was difficult to maneuver well enough to shave my legs. That being said, the room was nice, and it was evident that the Coral Princess is an older ship.My biggest complaint comes from the activities on board, or lack thereof. There were very few options for activities on board the ship unless you wanted to play trivia four or five times a day. During our at sea days, this was especially evident, and we found ourselves going a bit stir crazy. The cruise staff was very lackluster. The cruise staff: Brenna, Robbie, Danni and Sam were visibly bored with the trip and the clientele, which I understand given that they are on the trip over and over again. Still, I felt like there was not enough variety in the hosted activities. These guys were run ragged, and each activity lasted about 45 minutes, and it was always music trivia and Bingo.One day, there was a Wii with bowling, which was enjoyable. There was a day of stargazing in the Universe Lounge, but Robbie was not proficient enough with the computer program to make this enjoyable. I never saw the Wii again or karaoke after the brief period of time that they were done. The gameshows were not well executed either.The shows were good, except the magician bordered on being creepy with his tricks and jokes. While this post probably seems entirely negative, it is not. We enjoyed the trip immensely, but for the money we paid, it was disappointing to see the cruise staff so unenthused. Waiters walked around the Explorers Lounge constantly, but they would never offer to refill or ask about our drinks. instead, it often took over an hour for us to get our orders fulfilled.",Sail Date: June 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Family (older kids)|Destination: Alaska|,"Bradenton, Florida"

However, Luggage Forward did NOT deliver my luggage & LEFT ME WITHOUT CLOTHING FOR THREE WEEKS ON A CRUISE SHIP IN THE MIDDLE OF AN OCEAN. I contracted with Luggage Forward to ship two pieces of luggage from my home to a cruise ship in Ft. Lauderdale, FL for an approximate 3 week holiday cruise including Christmas and New Years Eve celebrations. Luggage Forward NEVER delivered my suitcase to the ship during  that three week period, even though Luggage Forward had guaranteed delivery AND made multiple promises to forward the undelivered suitcase to any one of our multiple ports of call. LF NEVER forwarded the suitcase despite many promises to do so. I even offered to go by taxi to the Panama airport to pick up the suitcase if LF would just send it. A Princess cruise representative phoned LF multiple times, instructing LF to put the suitcase on an American Airlines flight to Cartagena, Columbia and the suitcase would be delivered directly to the ship by the airline. LF declined to forward the suitcase no matter how many options they were given to do so. The suitcase contained over $7,000. worth of clothing including evening gowns, shoes & other items purchased exclusively for the cruise. Because of that loss, my @ $16,000. cruise was ruined. What my family was put through was a nightmare. The only clothing I had was the clothing I wore to board the ship. For three weeks I had no underwear, nightgowns, shoes, casual clothes, or evening wear for the four formal holiday dinners onboard. I spent our valuable vacation time washing clothes in the ship’s laundromat. I was forced to purchase over $2,500. worth of items on board the ship at incredibly inflated prices. I had no choice of where to buy items I  needed just to exist thru this emergency situation, as the only place to shop was the ship’s “boutique”. After many conversations with Luggage Forward, the company did reimburse the cost of the luggage transportation from Houston to Ft. Lauderdale, and offered an “apology”. LF admitted they failed to deliver as per their written guarantee. But LF will not reimburse any other expenses unless I agree to sign a non-disclosure agreement. I am not obligated or willing to be forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement.  LF asked for my receipts for items purchased because of the untenable position they put my family in. I faxed @ $2,200. in written receipts. I pointed out this was only a small portion of our loss, due to the time and money lost having to wash clothes every day instead of being able to enjoy the shipboard actives that I had paid for in our cruise fare. The amount of stress caused by LF’s failure to deliver the suitcase as guaranteed negated the very reason for the “vacation”. The company has not offered reimbursement for the $2,220 I was forced to spend. Why did LF ask for receipts they have NOT reimbursed? Instead LF offered an insulting $700. settlement, which would not even pay for the costs incurred having to contact LF over and over again. All calls to LF were “international calling” charges and using internet on the ship to contact LF cost $200. While no monetary amount could make up for the loss, $10,000. would be a reasonable reimbursement for what I was put though by LF’s incompetence.

There are no words adequate to describe this trip.The ship is great, not too big, not too small, so even in rougher seas, it does pretty well but small enough to do landings and see a lot.  Some of the amenities are over the top (butlers, sit down dinner service, superb chef and sommelier), but the expedition team was outstanding and it's unlikely you would get such a fantastic group on some of the lower key ships.  The all suite ship does have smaller and larger cabins, we were in mid-ship which was a good idea when it got rough (lower is better), The food and service is amazing not least the wait staff who had superb balance and a sense of humor, the staff gets to go on some of the landings and zodiacs to experience where we are, which I liked.  I also got my hair cut by a really good stylist (Madeline),  and a facial from the super masseuse/cosmetologist (Megan, also a fabulous entertainer with a great voice).  And they were really nice people, everyone was just super nice and friendly and seemed to like where they were working.The trip is incredible: Black browed Albatrosses and Rockhopper penguins nesting in West point, Falkland Islands, unbelieveable colonies of beautiful King penguins and their funny large brown chicks alongside fur seals and elephant seals in South Georgia, elephant seals and Macaroni and Gentoo penguins so numerous we could not even land but saw by zodiac on Elephant Island in two locations, the truly awesome Gerlache strait, Antarctic Sound and the Peninsula, with Adelie and Gentoo penguins nesting, alongside molting elephant seals, leopard seals, tons of whales including Humpbacks, Minkes, Fin, Southern Rights and Orca.  And finally South Shetlands with nesting Chinstrap colonies.  And then the Drake passage, which well, could have been worse but for the masterful sailing.  The crew under the capable Captain Andrey Domanin, showed their experience often, including when leaving the Antarctic Sound and having to push aside icebergs to get out of the Sound, not least sailing to and from South Georgia and through the Drake passage.  And nearly always, various birds around the ship including albatrosses, other petrels, terns and in the water penguins elegantly swimming and jumping through the water.The expedition team was fantastic, including Robin Aiello-the first woman to dive in Antarctica, Damien Sanders who spent years at the South Georgia research station and gave us the history, especially of the Shackleton expedition, Malcolm Turner who oversaw research on the Great Barrier Reef and is an experienced and knowledgeable ornithologist who also gave the climate change lecture (which was still questioned by some passengers), Ffion Rees, marine biologist whose whale lecture ended with a whale sighting, geologist James Lowe on the underwater and visible geology and volcanic and plate activity, Stephan Hauke, meteorology and sailing expert, Scott Kiefer, conservationist and last but not least, Luke Kenny the amazing and patient expedition leader whose announcements often were our alarm clocks and also had experience in the ""neighborhood"", and his capable staff, assistant Darryn Griffiths, coordinator Leonie Vieth, staffer Tania Jeken, photographer Ross McDonald.  All these people were incredibly knowledgeable, approachable, very nice, and quite funny.  Super story tellers who could and did make fun of themselves at times.This was our 40th wedding anniversary and also we had Christmas and New Years.  All great fun.  We did have the unfortunate experience of having to visit the doctor when an unfortunate accident with the wind ripped my husband's finger and both Dr. (Frans) and nurse (Angel) were super nice and very professional.  Luckily we did not have to get flown out as the injury was manageable with stitches and it happened on days at sea and early enough to allow him to wear gloves later on.  But it underscored the need for insurance to cover emergency flights and care.Biosecurity was taken very seriously to keep the environment pristine, which meant scrubbing boots, having all outer gear examined and cleaned.  We rented waterproof pants and boots which were delivered to our room and luckily fit and we and most people, wore the Silversea parkas so a sea of red jackets were often in view but helped us see how far the zodiacs actually were going for the expeditions.I could go on endlessly as this was the best trip I've ever taken and I was lucky enough to be able to do this.  It is expensive, but truly the trip of a lifetime.  I had no idea about South Georgia but so glad we went there so I would highly recommend this loop.  I wish I could do it again... perhaps I will.  And if you don't take climate change seriously, seeing pictures of the glaciers from the experienced staff's slides and how they have receded may change your mind and make you think twice about what you should support.  As this trip had people from many countries, this is a global question that hopefully will soon be answered differently so Antarctica will be able to have penguins for many years.",Sail Date: December 2019|Cabin Type: Suite|Type of Trip: |Destination: Antarctica|,

Our experience on an Indonesian cruise with Silversea expeditions showed how important it is to find a responsible vendor.  Silversea has utterly failed to meet its responsibility to its customers.In March of 2018 my wife and I purchased a cruise with Silversea from Bali Indonesia to Darwin Australia. By paying in full for the cruise one year in advance our contract with Silversea included round-trip airfare from Newark. We arrived at the airport at the appropriate time to find that our flight on Cathay Pacific to Hong Kong connecting to Bali was canceled.  We were told to return the next morning and that we were protected on a flight on United Airlines to Bali through Shanghai. As I was unable to confirm our seats online that evening, we returned to Newark airport early and again were unable to confirm our flight. United Airlines personnel were also unable to confirm our flight whereupon we were transferred to the “special help” line. After half an hour with the airline agent and subsequent calls between the agent and our travel agent, neither United nor our travel agent were able to contact Cathay Pacific *nor Silversea emergency help desk. Half an hour before the flight we were given two choices, miss the flight or pay $4000 for two “day of travel” tickets to Bali.*I was able to contact the Silversea after hours team but they were unable to resolve the problem.We paid the $4000. Our contract with Silversea also included trip interruption insurance.Upon return our travel agent contacted Silversea for reimbursement of the $4000 that we were charged for our trip to Bali.  Our travel agent has been in telephone and email contact with the Silversea representative, DeAnn Koehler for over five months to no avail. Ms. Koehler is absolutely unresponsive other than to say that she is taking care of it. We have not seen any “taking care”.We have now paid $4000 for airfare that Silversea was to include in our contract. We also missed a day of our trip in Bali. It appears at this point we have no choice but to litigate against Silversea to recover the money that we were required to pay to begin our excursion.

To visit Antartica one must be on cruise ship, unless you're part of some project, and the Silver Explorer was the right ship for me.The ship is perfect for this type of adventurous voyage -- relatively luxurious, small, and able to function in an environment like Antarctica.  While our suite couldn't compare to a five star hotel suite. it still featured all the comforts and amenities one would expect.  The dining room had windows everywhere and the stuff very attentive.  The meals were excellent and the variety of wines (all meals / drinks are included in the fare) while not exactly close to a Chateau Lafite were perfectly acceptable.  The decks, the lounges, the gym, the sauna, the outside Jacuzzi were just fine.But the real attraction was the fantastic otherworldly beauty of Antartica.  Those icy blue towering glaciers, the ice-covered landscape, and the thousands and thousands of penguins surviving and thriving under the harshest conditions on earth.All the expeditions were well-organized and the naturalists extremely friendly and  caring of the environment as well as of the passengers (many were seniors).  Then the lectures were all very well presented and educative.The only minus was the entertainment: a keyboard player rendering cheese versions of Hotel California.

They went out of their way to please and performed above and beyond expectations.   It is a small ship with cabins for about 120 passengers and 102 crew so the ratio means great service.   Food was very good.   This is a small ship and only had two dining options, a main dining room and an on deck grill.  Menus were creative and quality excellent for a ship like this.   Itinerary and activities were kind of specific but it is an “expedition” ship specializing in out-of-the-way small venues so small Pacific islands, some with small villages and some with deserted beaches, then Sulawesi with a small town, and Borneo and a visit to the Orangutang sanctuary.   Lots of beach time. Snorkeling and lectures on the flora and fauna in the area.   The ship is old.    While kept in perfect condition this ship is slated to be retired in July of 2019 and replaced with a new one so while I have a few issues with it such as funny tasting water and finicky A/C, this ship will not be part of the Silversas fleet in a month.

As we're getting on a bit, we wondered a bit about how we would cope hopping into and out of Zodiacs from the side of the ship, or beach landings, but the crew were so good we had very few issues and those were minor.Everything ran like clockwork, given the vagaries of winds and tides, and we saw some wonderful sights of glaciers, mountains, birds and animals. One real highlight was our visit to the Torre del Paine National Park. This is possibly one of the most beautiful places on earth! Completely natural, just breathtaking scenery and amazing fauna and flora.There were just two downsides, neither of which were directly attributable to Silver seas. On our last day at sea, we had been out whale-watching and were coming in to get some coffee when the ship lurched rather suddenly and my wife fell and hurt her back. There should have been a handrail along that small corridor, and the ship's officers who attended to her said they would get that done. Hopefully it has been. But on a small ship out in the Pacific Ocean it isn't all going to be smooth sailing, so we have no animosity because of this. She has recovered, though it took some time and her injury did mean that our travel back home was more difficult, although we had upgraded to business class flights, and just as well!The second was the check-in at the Sheraton in Santiago. This was arranged by a local agent with the hotel, and frankly it was a shambles. There were a lot of people to check in, but there was no pre-processing, no keys prepared, and so it too us close to 90 minutes before we had a room, which even then wasn't ready until later.But these things fade into insignificance compared with e sights we saw, the service we received, and the memories we retain.Silverseas are a premium brand, so relatively expensive, but for our money are one of the best, but if you are thinking of travelling with them, do book early and take advantage of every discount you can!",Sail Date: February 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: South America|,"Chinnor, United Kingdom"

Positives of the small ship included getting to know other passengers and staff. Negatives were lack of facilites: only one main restaurant and a deck cafe-style dining area; no cafes, only one tiny shop, no evening entertainment.

Nothing was too much trouble and attention to detail was extraordinary.  We chose a 'small ship experience' deliberately - 150 passengers and the same number of staff.  The Captain and all the Officers mixed freely and there was none of the 'Captain's Table' nonsense that you experience on large cruise ships.

You would go to the observation bar before lunch for a drink and then they would close the bar for an hour , You would be in the main lounge and ask a waiter for an orange juice .He would look at you and not respond ,you never knew if he went to get it or not. First night in the main dinning room ,the menu was so small ,we requested anything chicken or salmon .We were told that was not possible. Ended up with a burger and fries. This was not what we expected on a high end cruise. Next night is was a set gala dinner. Very poor small portions of different types of fish. So third night decided to go to the buffett .We arrived at 8pm to a very sparsely attended dining room. The head waiter asked if we had a reservation as all the empty tables were reserved .We told him no. He seated us at an empty table .We ate until 9pm ( good food this night) and only 10 other guests showed up. This buffett closes at 9pm. For breakfast you have a 2 hour window mainly 7am to 9am. They will start clearing your plates that you are eating on at 8.45am .Just plain crazy .Staff need training. Our first port of call from Vancouver was San Francisco .It took near 5 hours to clear customs .I asked a customs officer when we finally got cleared why the hold up. He said it was lack of communications on compliance from the ship's crew. We have cleared this port many times on bigger ships in less than 2 hours.

The vessel has an open bar policy that includes drinks, apéritif, cocktails, champagne, digestif, and wines - with the exception of the grand crus. The wine list is impressive and top wines are on display at the right temperature and available at the restaurant on deck 2.Dress code is smart-casual with a couple of extra-smart nights although no rules are laid down. For Arctic and Antarctic voyages Ponant provides a parka and rubber boots. Passengers often go seriously chic and we advise ladies to pack a cocktail dress and some heels for the smarter nights. There's no requirement for men to pack jackets and ties, although a lot of men did wear blazers on the smart nights. Numerous activities, from gymnastics in the morning, lectures in the afternoon to a piano concert or a dance show at night in the theatre. At sea the ship has an open bridge policy. Food is French cuisine and very good. For suites there is a butler service. At the restaurant the French tone of course is prevalent. All officers are French, the crew a mixture of Filipino and Indonesian, and all English speaking.We had a great voyage. Although we missed the North West Passage we visited remote places like Sisimiut, Ilulissat, Akullek, Kullorsuaq, Savissivil, Pond Inlet, Trembley, Fort Ross, Qariaraqyuk, Somerset, Philpots, Devin, Coburg, Ellesmere, Craig Harbour, Fjord Bowdoin, Siorapaluk, Etah, Dundas, Thule, Qagsserssuaq, Nuliafrik and Qullissat.Overall Le Soléal is a beautiful ship, no casino and no rowdy teenagers.",Sail Date: September 2018|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Canada|,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands"

There are only three in this category - all on the 6th level.My ratings are:Cabin - excellent, though the ante-room is all closets which makes the room a bit dark as you enter.   Same cabin on its sister-ship, L’Austral, has a slightly different (and I think better) configuration with more natural light and on entering, you can see straight thru the beautiful cabin to the balcony.Food:  better than excellent — it is French!    Complimentary wine at meals, open bar, complimentary mini-bar.  There are two restaurants:  a buffet on the 6th level; and waiter service with  multi-courses on the 2nd level.     I especially like that the maitre d’s  at both restaurants organize a “share” table at meals which is wonderful for those on our own.  Services — Staff are 5-star in every wayExcursions — most of the cruises I’ve taken with Ponant have been expedition-type, so all excursions are included.   The Pacific trips were mainstream cruises.  On these  trips, however,   over half the excursions were included, We were also given snorkel equipment to use during the entire cruiseActivities — you won’t be bored - even on at-sea days.  I especially enjoyed the morning stretching class and the afternoon pool exercise class.  Get there early for the morning class to make sure you have a mat.   Organization —  whoever plans the excursions, activities,  concerts,etc. is superb.  Moving 200+ people on and off a ship to where they want to go  (touring, snorkeling, beach vsit, etc) is no easy feat.Price:  the larger discounts seem to be when the itineraries are announced.

When we arrived at Santiago airport it was extremely busy but there were plenty of team members from Silver Sea to guide us through the airport and send us off in our transfer to the Mandarin Oriental Hotel.  This is undergoing a refurbishment but all amenities were open and there was no disruption to their operations. Once we'd collected our itinerary, boarding passes etc. we spent a few hours by the pool before dining in the Senso restaurant with a few other couples who were also on the trip. Unfortunately, while the food looked great, one of our party had to send their steak back twice and another had under-cooked mussels which they also sent back. An early night ready for a 3am start and flight to Ushuaia on LATAM airlines.  The queues at the airport security were very long even at this time of the morning meaning almost an hour standing in one queue or another.  When we finally boarded the plane its pretty basic. Very little leg room, narrow seats and no chance of catching up on some sleep, but the scenery as you fly south is beautiful.  Look out for the snow capped volcanoes which are stunning.Once we landed in Ushuaia we were taken on a short sight seeing tour and then onto an Argentinian lamb BBQ.  I loved it, but not one for the vegetarians on the boat with only a pasta and tomato sauce alternative.   Back to the Silver Cloud and once on board it was first class food, drink and service all the way. Our butler ""JonJon"" made sure he stocked the bar with our favorite drinks and couldt do enough to help us with restaurant bookings and general info.The Expedition team were brilliant. Each a specialist in their own field but also a generalist on most thing Antarctica. No question was too trivial despite the fact they must have been asked it a thousand times before and they always had time to discuss the events of the day or plans for tomorrow.The daily briefings were very informative and helpful as well as numerous other lectures throughout the cruise to help make the whole expedition a full on experience and all the kit provided is first class.We were very lucky with the weather, experiencing just one day of 4m swells but experienced the Drake Lake on the outbound leg and minor swells on our return.All the restaurants on bvoard are first class. The main restaurant is first class, the Bar and Grill serves Burgers but its the steak and prawns on hot rocks that draws everyone.  La Dame is a beautiful French style restaurant which becomes all the more enchanting as you watch giant icebergs drift by, but i was a little disappointed with La Terrazza.  The menu didnt vary much and the buffet lunch could be a bit of a free for all, but the quality of food was again excellent.TIP - If you want to experience La Terazza, La Dame or The Grill, book them online in advance. You can always cancel up until 2pm on the day of the reservation and after the first day at sea La Dame and The Grill were fully booked for the week!Plenty of wildlife to see and we got phenomenally close to it all the the expert help of the Expedition Team.In the evening, there were quiz's & karaoke and plenty of space for everyone to get together with friends they have made on the trip and to catch up on the days events  sharing their stories and pictures.The final day saw us in our Zodiac boats, surrounded by Humpback Whales which came closer than I could have ever imagined and the chance to take the Antarctic Plunge which IS as cold as you think it will be but what an experience!This trip has me hooked on Expedition Tours and i'll definitely book another.",Sail Date: February 2020|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Antarctica|,"Cambridge, United Kingdom"

The Cloud is the oldest ship in the fleet but was recently remodeled and hardened to be an ice class ship.  Now with just over 200 passengers in the Antarctic it never seems crowded and the food and beverage options are all world class,  I had a wonderful experience with the Silver Sea expedition class ship in the Galapagos.  There the government places extreme restrictions on food that can be served and mandates local staffing.  The 27 expedition staff on Cloud were stellar but multiple restaurants and room service that were available for each meal and the staff comprised of well trained professionals from across the fleet created an over the top experience.  The cruise package starts with an overnight in Santiago at the Mandarin which is a beautiful and well located hotel still in the last stages of a renovation.  The next day starts at 3am for a charter flight to Ushuaia were you join the ship after a tour and lunch at a local restaurant.  We met our butler in our cabin where the boots, parka and other protective clothing was waiting and our bar was stocked with our favorites from previous cruises.  Both crossings of the Drake Passage were surprisingly uneventful.  It was one of many times that we appreciated the larger ship that had been outfitted with new and more powerful engines designed to preform  well in  Arctic conditions.  The two days of transit to Antarctica where filled with orientation meeting and a host of excellent lectures from the team on board. All of our Zodiac ""landings""involved stepping into knee deep water to get on shore. Each guide has years of experience and exhibited a profound appreciation for the region, the wild life  and the extreme beauty and tranquility we were experiencing. The ships captain , Eric Saint Plancat, found amazing locations for the excursions and even a good spot for satellite reception so that we could enjoy an ship wide Super Bowl party.  Perhaps one of the most memorable incidents occurred when the expedition staff spotted a large pod of Orcas.  The captain turned the ship and provided us with an unbelievable viewing of the pod teaching the younger members to hunt a seal.   A growing number of ships visit the Antarctic each season.  I highly recommend the Cloud for your trip.  By day you have amazing expedition experiences and at night you can experience fine French dinning in La 'Dame.

We recently took their 17 day cruise to Greenland, which turned out to be very disappointing.  The scenery was nice at first, but very monotonous after a few days.  If it weren't for the interesting shapes of the icebergs, there would have been nothing to photograph.  The villages on both the Canadian and Greenland side were uninteresting.  We had hoped to see wildlife but there almost no signs of anything living.  The one polar bear we saw was so far away that it couldn't be made out with the naked eye and the whale spouts were so far away they couldn't be seen either.  The most annoying thing was that the cruise director and expedition crew were constantly talking about what an incredible day we had.  Maybe riding in zodiacs in below freezing weather and getting soaked while seeing little of interest is exciting for some people, but definitely not for us.Our cabin was nice, but we experienced a flood along with several other cabins in our row.  No one attempted to help us with the damage we incurred and we were told that we were lucky since we had minimal damage and others had much worse.  The extent of their help was to put a large noisy fan inside our room for a couple of days.  Knowing that our cabin was probably going to be affected when it happened, they should have been proactive when they were working in the corridor all night with noisy equipment and warned us to remove items from the floor in the closet.  By the time we discovered the problem it was too late to save the things in our backpack, some of which were not replaceable.  We bought our own boots for wet landings and tagged them as instructed.  We wore them once and when we went to the mud room after a few days for another excursion we found that someone had helped themselves to one boot from each pair.  If you invest in your own boots it would be wise to clean them and keep them in your cabin at night.Already soured on the trip after these experiences, the final straw was the guest relations manager's rudeness.  Far from appeasing passengers who were upset her attitude actually caused us to cancel our already booked Kamchatka cruise and to not book the Antarctica cruise we planned to book while on board.  The food in the main dining room is mostly very good, although there were a few days with some big misses.  La Terrazza is good, but the menu choices don't offer much variety.  The disappoinment is La Dame, for which you pay $120.  It isn't worth the money.

A three week expedition cruise- and an amazing adventure. While this 'crossing' does not go into Antartcia directly it stops in various hard to reach places - like South Georgia and Tristan da Cunha. There is only one sailing each year! Entering our balcony cabin our pre ordered Parka (you get to keep it- the warmest , amazing Parka ever- I wish I had had this when we climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro in 2017!)  and the rented boots and water resistant pants, together with the gift of expedition water bottles and backpacks were already waiting for us- together with a welcome bottle of champagne. This is not a regular cruise- it is an expedition cruise, filled with lectures (no shows or other kind of entertainment) and amazing days out on the Zodiacs, surrounded by penguins, seals, sea elephants and well: Nature at it's best. Because there is such a restricted amount of ships and with that 'humans' that travel to these islands each year it is a once in a lifetime adventure- the animals are fearless, and the history behind these particular expeditions is simply fascinating. The sailing itinerary can slightly vary because the crew watches the weather very closely and sometimes it is impossible to anchor and go ashore in these remote islands. Nature dictates!Again- There is no entertainment on the ship other than lectures- however, the explorer team of experts is fun to be with, they are very knowlegdeable and each has a story to tell-they are  available on deck on sea days for bird - and whale-watching and sometimes just to share the odd  story or answer questions, help with photography issues etc, . Also, the crew is amazing on Silversea- I appreciate the fact that no gratuities are expected (on other cruiseslines it seems on top of the guests paying for the cruise they also have to pay for the staff so that they end up with a decent income, unfortunately) , it is up to you- but the staff is amazing, friendly , courteous, professional and everybody seems genuinely happy and proud the be part of the Silversea family. While the food in the main restaurant was good, but not as amazing as we are used to from former 'regular', non expedition cruises on Silversea, I want to mention the hot rock grill your own on the outside pool deck every evening- absolutely amazing!!Bottom line: If you 'are into nature' expedition cruising is the way to go- and Silversea is awesome!",Sail Date: March 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Antarctica|,"Las Vegas, Nevada"

My wife and I had  a wonderful 34-day cruise in spring 2019 from Capetown to Lisbon, stopping at 17 places in western Africa. Our suite was great, as were the staff and the public areas. Food ranged from good to very good, sometimes excellent. There were shortcomings. Three scheduled ports were dropped before we left because of security issues. People booking this cruise in the future need to know they may not get all the ports they paid for. Also, not all the ship excursions were well-run and supervised. And the enrichment speakers could have been better.The Ship. Built in 1994 and heavily refurbished in 2017, the Cloud looks like a real ship. It’s almost perfectly maintained.  Painters were frequently seen doing touch-ups, a sign of a well-run vessel. Suites have pleasant, usable balconies, two chairs, a sofa, a coffee table and a desk, and small but utilitarian bathrooms with a shower. Storage space was okay. We asked to have one chair removed, as it crowded the room and wasn’t needed, but the staff refused. Soundproofing between rooms was inadequate. Basic wifi was free and worked well most of the time. Air conditioning was okay. We had Room 622—a perfect location. The pool area had sufficient lounges, but one of the whirlpools was too cold and sometimes closed and complaints failed to correct the situation. The captain, Vincent Taillard, and the ship officers were cordial but standoffish. The social director, Moss Hills, was delightful. And quietly famous. Years ago, with another company, he helped lead the successful abandonment of a sinking cruise ship.The Food. We’re critical people, and we mostly enjoyed the meals. A few dishes seemed too edgy. The breakfast buffet could have used more variety. And, like seemingly all cruise ships, the Cloud featured awful frozen hash-brown potato patties. A reuben sandwich at lunch was terrible. How about some simple recognizable grilled sandwiches? Overall, we had good choices and found the food at least good and sometimes excellent. I had fillet mignon four times—really good each time. Wine and cocktails flowed freely. We enjoyed every glass of wine we drank, although we realize they don’t serve $40-a-bottle wine. Room service food was good. Waiters were good. The Restaurant, where you don’t need reservations, was the best. La Terrazza, which features Italian in the evening, lacked variety. The Grill, on the outdoor deck, features a grill-your-own meat on a hot volcanic rock. We went once. Never again. I guess some people like the concept. We don’t. Why not just have a good outdoor grill/barbecue? There is a specialty French restaurant that requires a steep extra charge.The Expedition. The Cloud fell short here. Admittedly the itinerary was ambitious, including places were many ships never go, in a difficult environment. We wanted to experience the sights and culture of west Africa first-hand. We did. Every port offered a least one shore excursion covered by the ship fare. Some were great. Some were okay. Some sadly lacking. Some didn’t deliver what was promised when we reserved. Guides were sometimes poor. Supervision from the ship expedition staff was too-frequently lacking. The expedition leader, Nicki D’Souza, was not up to the task. Silversea needs to hire people from Tauck to demonstrate how to run tours. We had one great speaker—a former top assistant to Nelson Mandela. But where were the black professors, journalists or politicians from west Africa? Not on our ship.Conclusion. We’re not sure we’d book the cruise again. It’s really expensive. The missed ports and the shaky shore excursions were irritating. We could and should have gotten more for our money.

The cuisine, as one would expect, is gourmet and there is complimentary 24 hour room service for those who so desire. On my cruise entertainment included several singers and dancers, a guitar player and professionally trained classical pianist. There is also a lecturer, giving separate presentations in the theater in English and French. Shore excursions sold onboard are varied.

We traveled with our kids 8 and 10 and just got home from an 8 night Mediterranean cruise onboard the Le Lyrial.  We LOVED this ship.  The staff were amazing, there was a kids club that I couldn't pull my kids from (more on that), and we were very pleased with the food.  Cabins:Cabins are adequate in size.  We have been on Royal Caribbean and Disney boats and the Deluxe Balcony stateroom was just as big, with a decent sized balcony.  We had cabins 323 and 325, both rooms were perfect for 2 ppl per cabin with plenty of storage.  They took out the balcony divider between out staterooms so we could come and go between the cabins.  These staterooms do not connect from the inside.Kids Club:There was a kids club on this cruise, which I don't think is offered on all the itineraries.  If there's a kids club, it will be listed. My kids loved kids club.  The activities they provided for the children were entertaining. No there is not a basketball court, or all the other kids stuff you find on the Disney and RC boats, but my kids never complained about not having that.  In fact, they told us this was the best kids club they've been too.   Port stops:Because this is a smaller boat, you port in smaller ports and getting off the boat is so much less stressful. Ponant organizes everything to a ""T"" and we were very impressed with the tours they provided. We generally do not book cruise ship tours, but these tours never had any more than 20 ppl in a group, again a BONUS being on a smaller boat.Food and Dining:Food was great!  There are 2 restaurants and we never had a problem getting seating at either of them. I do wish they had a couple more options for the included house wines.  With this being a french boat, I was looking forward to tasting some good french wines.  They do have them, but they come at a cost.  Pool Deck:Never crowed.  On a Mediterranean cruise one would have thought you would have problems finding a chair.  We never did.  Also, ppl do not reserve chairs with towels, which was nice!  There were 122 people onboard our ship.  Amazing!  I can't imagine we will ever be able to go back to a bigger boat after being on the Le Lyrial.  I would also like to add that our tour manager, Nina was phenomenal.  She organized all our excursions, and they went above and beyond to make sure we had the best experience possible.  For example, we booked an excursion that was not offered as an inclusion to the US passengers, and was given only in French. My husband and I knew this going into it. We fully expected that we were going on a French speaking excursion and were ok with that.  To our surprise, Nina had organized an English speaking guide to accommodate us that day.  It was like we had our on personal guide.  We did not expect this at all!  But again, this is Ponant, and Nina was just exceptional.  All in all we will book again with Ponant.  Not having to deal with the crowds on embarking and disembarking is so worth the extra cost!

To our dismay, the cruise was a disaster!  We had been told that the ship had been updated, which was untrue- water leaked Into and through the windows in our cabin and, in our friend’s luxury suite, it soaked the carpeting. Additionally, the meals were not up to Silver Seas standards and our expectations.We had to spend 2 days at sea due to weather and the inability to dock in our ports.  This was of course unavoidable, however there were no activities planned to occupy the passengers during this time.  OOn the final day of the cruise, staff indicated that a rope might have been caught in a propeller, so we could not dock as intended.  Passengers were told that their flights would be rescheduled as necessary and they would be notified.  We were notified 7 hours later that our flight was rescheduled for the following day (even though my husband had found a direct flight that would allow us to return that same evening), but staff indicated all changes had to be processed by staff in Miami. At 3pm we had still not received any information about debarkation, consequently we took our luggage to the lobby, only to find an area in total chaos with uninformed passengers waiting for lodging, flight and debarkation info.I was allowed to leave the ship, however my husband, directly behind me, was denied, saying there had been a change in plans.  I sat in a warehouse for 1 hour waiting with our luggage before he arrived.  Approximately 1/2 hr later a woman escorted us to a bus and told us they were taking us to a hotel.  It turned out to be a Westin.  We were dropped off and given a cab pass to reach the airport the next day.  There was no additional compensation for meals and other incidental expenses - we were on our own.  We did arrive home safely 24 hours later- fortunately our siitter was able to accommodate our change in plans.  BUT HERE IS THE DISTURBING PART!!!! UPON CALLING  SILVERSEAS TO DISCUSS MY CONCERNS I WAS TOLD BY THREE SEPARATE DEPARTMENTS AND 4 INDIVIDUALS THAT I COULD NOT DISCUSS MY CONCERNS WITH ANYONE………I WOULD HAVE TO WRITE A LETTER TO GUEST RELATIONS.  I complied with their request and wrote, indicating my concerns about their inability to manage passengers in emergency situations..among other cruise concerns. When I did not receive a call back as requested, I once, again contacted SilverSeas- I was told it took 4 to 6 weeks to receive a reply,  Yikes.  This week, 8 weeks after the cruise, I finally did receive a “cut and paste “ and condescending letter.  Summary: they would forward my concerns to the appropriate parties, and offered a mere $800 voucher (for two) on a future cruise!

Our expectations were totally set too high it seems or rather set at a level that the average cruise passenger would ""expect"". On boarding we were amazed at the luxury appearance of the ship and indeed we were excited and delighted to be on-board and then...1. Our cabin was superficially cleaned with a used bathrobe left in the closet, finger makers (not ours) on the cabin window, the dust on the furniture was more than evident and for someone who has hay fever it was very noticeable. The cabin, in fairness, was appropriate and functional. On closer inspection the cabin was tired, superficial repairs of cabin items, and utilities poorly maintained (toilet failed a few times).2. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner was rather impressive in terms of food choice and then...we found knives and forks with fingerprint marks, we found a few pieces of human hair in our porridge, some dishes served lukewarm only, whilst some dishes missing condiments as shown on the menu. The dress code was really joke with jackets for men at dinner being mandatory (really!).3. Staff were functional and friendly (perhaps too friendly) but then...we found that most of the staff (99%) were from Eastern Europe and unfortunately lacked the professional requirements of fine dining. Waiters saw their job as functional rather than 'service' oriented with a lack of understanding of the basics of table service with wines poured without asking, wines poured into glasses which had another wine type in it, wines poured to high levels, failure to have butter on the tables (we had to ask every time) and boot plated cleared which some guests were still eating at our table. The waiters were somewhat over friendly and at times making jokes at tables that were poorly delivered and/or un-welcome. Unfortunately their command of the English language was poor which created difficulties in ordering meals with variations.4. Excursions - these were all pre-planned and we were looking forward to our off-shore visits and then...various excursions were cancelled, two fundamental port calls were cancelled due to bad weather, whilst others were poorly organised with one off-shore visit requiring a 40 minute waiting in a queue.5. Entertainment was very good so a well done to the young cast. The scheduled 'Talks' were more like lectures rather than entertainment.6. Ship Announcements were daily and via speakers rather than in person which would have been better and more collegial allowing cruise passengers to mix and network.7. Weather was wonderful for most of the time and then...we encountered a few days of severe weather. Quite frankly we were of the view that the trip should have been delayed until the weather passed rather than proceeding sailing in storm seas - quite frightening really. Whilst bad weather is beyond the control of Silverseas the safety of passengers is more critical than keeping to schedule.In summary, we enjoyed the scenery, cruising on crisp and sunny days, and we also had a good social time thanks to the people we met on-board but we are unlikely to sail Silversea again.",Sail Date: October 2019|Cabin Type: Inside|Type of Trip: |Destination: United States|,"Sydney, Australia"

Seems like they have cut corners with some food and service from previous silver seas trips . may b on a newer ship  . but bravo to the hotel staff again what terrfic tryers they were !",Sail Date: October 2019|Cabin Type: Suite|Type of Trip: |Destination: Canada|,"Sydney, Australia"

Stumbled upon the Silver Seas cruise line website and was surprised to see an all inclusive, 300 guest cruise ship. Yes very! expensive but unbelievable service. Butler for every room (never had that before!!), any food or drink any time any where! All of the crew extremely helpful and courteous!! Fabulous 9 day cruise thru the Southern Caribbean. Zero complaints but the cost may prevent us from rushing to book again.",Sail Date: January 2019|Cabin Type: Balcony|Type of Trip: |Destination: Caribbean|,"Surrey, Canada"

The water was 3 inches deep throughout our cabin!  These things can happen on a ship. HOWEVER, how we were treated afterward should have NEVER happened.  We were told that there were no other available cabins at the time of the incident and that we would have to sleep in the wet/musty cabin for one more night.  On day 3, they moved us to another cabin.  That cabin had no air-conditioning.  We alerted guest relations and maintenance. We were told that the air was functioning normally (even though there was NONE!)  We made our complaint known to the hotel manager.  No further action was taken by the ship.  We were stuck in a cabin that had no air conditioning.  We asked for a partial refund; they refused to do anything for us.  On day 5, we decided to get off the ship early and fly home. We have taken 74 cruises.. and have NEVER gotten off of a cruise before the end.  Ever!  Once back home, we contacted Silver Sea main office.  They also refused to do anything for us.  We will NEVER cruise on Silver Sea again.",Sail Date: February 2019|Cabin Type: Outside|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Caribbean|,"Manalapan, Florida"

Perhaps the Cabins ( Suites as Silversea call them ) could do with some updating and I believe this is planned later this year before the Wind joins the Silversea Expedition Fleet.  Bathrooms are unbelievably small.  Small tub with shower over!One of the many joys of the Silver Wind is it size, with a Guest capacity of 296.  As one fellow Guest observed as we docked in a Caribbean Island mais Harbour, the entire Crew and Guest list could be accommodated in just one lifeboat af the Azure of the Seas docked alongside us and carrying over 5000 Guests!Service on the Ship was second to none.  Always a smile from the Crew and nothing too much trouble.  Food was of a high order and we especially enjoyed the Italian fare in the Terrazza.        We did treat ourselves to a special Dinner in Le Dame (at a supplement)Wines were very drinkable and the wine waiters always very willing to find for you a wine that suited you.   In suite mini bar worked well for us for a pre, pre dinner drink.Unlike Regent the excursions are extra.  Some were a little mixed in terms of quality and value.   We did have a on board credit to soften the pain of the cost!Not sure I would want to return to the Caribbean on a Cruise, as all the ports are litterally over run with cruise ships........many ports had 5 or 6 ships in dock, and due to their enormous size disgourging 15000/ 16000 people into the local facilities.",Sail Date: February 2019|Cabin Type: Suite|Type of Trip: Couple|Destination: Caribbean|,
